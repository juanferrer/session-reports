## Session 2

Back in the present, we were startled by the sheriff, who wanted to have a word with us. We followed him to his office.

He asked the usual questions and was checking our answers. He mentioned old Gurt, a hermit old woman living alone in the woods. People usually visit her for "remedies".

When we asked, Ginger said she shot the last people who visited.

West out of town, a mile down the road, follow the left down the fork. "That's where evil lurks". We will visit at noon tomorrow.

That night I have bad dreams with bad smells and ooze. Ooze on me.. in me... Very disturbing...

We leave the next morning. The forest is very thick and the athmosphere is eerie.

After avoiding Gert's dog, we spoke with her. She was surprised to see us again. I mentioned the ritual had gone wront and asked if she could explain it to us in more detail. She said we just have to "Hold the bottle up and it would drive away all the evil spirits."

Apparently we gave her the book as payment. She gave us "the bottle of protection".

I showed her the relic. It still feels wrong. Imbued with something, but not the right thing. It feels angry, as if the outcome was not what it expected.

We managed to get another bottle of protection from her in exchange for "the finest lady Bulldog for Jasper". She bought it. I'm going to kill that dog.

As we left the shack, Solomon noticed a note stuck to his shoe:

>Gert,
>
>I've sent Clarence with this note and the book you requested, as I think its best if I am not seen visiting with you, even though it seems they don't remember anything of the last few days just like you said. Thank you for your kind offer of protection, but having seen how it worked out for those Old One fools I think I'll politely decline! Besides, I plan to use the essence on myself so your "protection" won't be necessary.
>Savoiur's blessings be upon you,
>
>Annie

Annie is Ginger, the barkeep. She's set us up... Did she take the book from us?

As we were pondering these things, we recovered memories of that night. Fish jumping into the boat. A wave was coming... or was it a creature? Tentacles? What an odd dream...

Definitely a creature. It roared and Solomon held up the "bottle of protection". Something was sucked into the bottle. Is this the essence?

Bob said Clarence is Annie's brother and one of his fishing crew.

Here's Solomon's plan: we get Bob to take Clarence fishing in his boat.

Bob came back saying that Clarence was busy behind the bad. Solomon fast talked him into running to help Ginger in "a matter of life and death". We followed him towards the lake... and into the Church of the Savior. He rushed in and we followed shortly after.

We prepared our guns and went in, preparing to barge into the office at the back. We went through the different rooms. They had it booby trapped. That's illegal! Downstairs we found several more rooms, much better than our basement. Hmm...

Anyways, down the hallway on the right we found Ginger and a few other cultist, all chanting and praying. They spotted us and we raised our guns.

My gun jammed just as the cultist came to me. He punched me in the face, but Solomon shot him in the arm.

Ginger dropped the bottle and swirling darkness sprung up from the broken bottle. Tentacles emerged from the darkness and surrounded her. She transformed into this horrid beast with goat legs, long claws and sharp teeth. Her hair was still red, though.

After a difficult fight where Solomon nearly died and I nearly lost my arm, I put a torch to her head and she caught fire. She was very quickly consumed by the fire and all was left was a pile of ash.

We checked the rest of the building and found a similar book than the one we lost and Solomon took it.

In the sheriff's office, we reported being attacked by a dog while fetching lumber to repair Bob's ship (damaged from the storm a few days past). We had the wounds to prove it and asked for the dog to be put down. He agreed and sent us to the doctor's surgery.

The next day, we went to brief father Augustine about our progress. He pleaded we retrieve the book. When we showed him the one Solomon took from the Church of the Saviour, he was immediately frightened at the possibility of the book falling into the wrong hands and suggested we burned it. Instead, Solomon discovered a way to wield its power, and we performed a ritual to make an asteroid fall on old Gert's hut. This was after exchanging this new book with the one she had and give some poisoned meat to Jasper, the bulldog.

All in all, a categorical success.
