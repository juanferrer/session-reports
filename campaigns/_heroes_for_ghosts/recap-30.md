After killing the mould creature the party cleaned up with some scorching rays and had a discussion on tree sex. Adrik took some apples from Split-Sprout, agreeing to plant them outside the Mournland. Abel tried to discern what the six legged creature the trees had warned them of might be. She produced a stick drawing of an ant and the trees agreed it looked like the creature. 
 
Over the corridor Adrik politely tried knocking on the door to the Royal Physician office which resulted in a confusion spell cast at the party when the door was opened. Elora quickly counter-spelled it and the rest of the encounter was a cakewalk, cumulating in "Ant Man" being polymorphed into a tortoise and dropped 400ft off one of the tower bridges. 
 
A floor down Elora found the old school house used to educate children of the palace workers. Rushing into the room three of the party found themselves transported back over a century to one of Elora's critical thinking classes. Mr Puckery offered the prise of looking after Mr Spits, the class pet flying snake, to the wining group. Turned out Mr Puckery should have chosen some harder riddles as the other kids didn't even get a chance to go, and our heroes found themselves back in present day with the Kundarak key rune in the long dead Mr Spits' terrarium.
 
Before leaving the Palace of Light a quick trip was made to the cellars. The Reforged had looted all the food, but having no use for alcohol, all the wines and spirits remained. Trunkie was restocked, almost to bursting with the finest wines and spirits they could find.
 
A mile south at Shaman Dha'iteags house, a letter was found. The party figured it seemed to be written for them and that the author had prior knowledge of the Mourning. A create was located, contained within a truckle of cheese floating inside some arcane device that seemed to be for transporting SOAs. Instruction for how to assembled and dissemble the device, along with a spell scroll defining the spell needed to power it, were also located within. The party decided the whole situation had the smell of Toquill about it.
 
Adrik asked to spend the afternoon and evening in the workshop, starting on a blacksmithing project he wanted to undertake. The rest got down to reading the books they had borrowed from the palace library. RIP asked the gods if they were on course to find another SOA and got a positive feeling they were. Plans were set to tackle the Arch Mage next. Once again the possibility of peace talks was floated, but RIP shot it down, vowing "there can be no peace with that monster".
 
In the morning Able made use of the Zafu to project her vision across the city and scout a safe path to the Palace of Storms. The group decided to try and sneak in and fight if necessary. However arriving at the palace they realised the high and thick walls were an obstacle to most of their spells and the open plaza before the main gate would make a stealthy approach impossible. A distraction was needed!
 
Deciding simply setting fire to a house might not get the desired response the party decided to go big! The Palace of Spirit proved to be a perfect target. A collection of flammable materials was piled up on one of the upper floors along with several barrels of anointing oil. Abel made a time delay fuse and the party legged it back across the city, looking back over their shoulders as the explosion took out most of the roof and one side of the palace. Over three dozen Watchers poured out of the Palace of Storms to go fight the blaze, running straight past the hidden heroes. Elora snatched the door patch off her robe of useful items and slapped it on the gate.
 
Stepping though, Elora barred the door with an immovable rod, and Abel disabled the gate with her tinkers tools. Ahead lay the imposing Palace of Storms, with its single door. Elora took one more patch from her robe and created a windowâ€¦
