**Start Date**: 27th Dravago (near midnight )

The Party agreed to General Nordar's plan and briefly interrogated the torturer (Viph), learning a selection of prisoners had been fed to the Ziggurat, enabling it to be activated and causing violent bouts of madness in the town above. Viph also confirmed The Sisters were expected the next day but he did not know when. After Nordar summarily executed the Halfling the Party made a quick search of their surroundings, set alarms and bed down for a rest.
 
The General gave an inspiring speech and the Party headed off into the ruins while she went to retrieve the CPAD. Only a few feet into the caverns the Party came across a horrifying gibbering mound of flesh that appeared to be mostly comprised of mouths, eyes, mouths within mouths and the occasional mouth full of eyes! The sight of the creature proved too much for RIP and Adrik who were driven to randomly attacking each other in their panic. Fortunately Able and Elora were able to deal with the beast from a safe distance.
 
A little way further on the caverns opened up into a wide raven separated by a broken bridge. The Party spent a couple of minutes loudly debating the best way to cross - drawing the attention of a nearby aberration. The floating octopus like beast quickly engaged the Party with a number of psychic rays that left RIP and Adrik pinned high up the cavern wall, Elora disgusted by its eye-tipped-tentacles and the already not too speedy Able slowed.	The creature attempted to drop Adrik and RIP - but both were able to parkour skilfully down the cave wall and evading fall damage. Badly hurt by crossbow shots and magic missiles the creature charged them and nearly killed the wizard with its tentacle attack before RIP detonated the creature's main eye with a sacred flame.
 
A convoluted plan to cross the chasm was drawn up involving ladders, expanding poles and ropes… which mostly resulted in members of the Party falling and eventually just being hauled up by the ropes lowered by Adrik, who had made the climb without difficulty.
 
Reaching an area of weirdly engraved cut stone the Party could see off in the distance a glowing device atop the Ziggurat… but between them and it a room of eight statues, each covering its eyes with their stony hands. Sensing a trap investigations were made and detect magic cast. RIP cast Augury to ask the gods about what would happen if they crossed the room and received the answer:
 
Don't blink.
Blink and you're dead.
Don't turn your back.
Don't look away.
And don't blink.
 
The Players lost their minds in terror while the Party were not completely sure what to do… Adrik blinked! Able suggested placing the disembodied eyestalks (cut from the Mindwittness) at the feet of the statues.
 
As they moved up to the main room housing the Ziggurat the three Sisters appeared at its apex; Mahari had the appearance the woman who offered the party a deal to steel the CPAD; Coteh had the appearance of Ms Ain who interviewed the Party for the job at Toquil's; the third redheaded witch had not been seen before. They discussed the progress the locals had made with the device:
 
>\- Salman: "Well it looks like that fool managed to get it working"
>\- Coteh: "Yes Salman - I hear there has been quite a ruckus in the town"
>\- Mahari: "What of the gnomish weapon?"
>\- Coteh: "The General stubbornly refused to give it up"
>\- Salman: "It matters not - this looks far more promising"
>\- Coteh: "True, sister. But it is only affecting the goblinkin. We need it attuned to the humans, gnomes, dwarves and elves"
>\- Mahari: "And we cannot move it"
>\- Salman: "There may be more. The Daughters believe the Outsiders may have built several"
>\- Mahari: "Did you bring the dragon shards? We should try those"
>\- Salman: "Coteh what of the group of sell swords you hired? They seemed more capable than we intended. Will they be a problem?"
>\- Coteh: "Last I scryed they had a little trouble with The Trust in Trollenport but perhaps I should look into them now"
 
"No need to scry!" Elora called out, and the battle began with her casting Tasha's Hideous Laughter on Mahari - leaving her a giggling wreck for the whole of the fight. RIP attempted a silence spell, which forced the witches to move away from the Ziggurat but did not stop them retaliating. Various spells, charms and curses were cast and weapons were swung. Elora spent a few confusing seconds as duck… before eventually with a nice Path To The Grave and Magic Missile combo from RIP and Able Coteh was slain. Elora set an immovable rod in the mouth of the still giggling Mahari pinning her to the ground. General Nordar arrived with the CPAD - calling for the Party to clear the room as she swung the weapon round her head before launching it towards the Ziggurat. 
 
The multiple implosions caused by the CPAD detonation obliterated the Ziggurat and surrounding structure leaving a pile of broken rocks and hole leading up to the castle above.
