Elora was a spy for the Cyrean army. Adrik is very confused now...
The refugees are all going to Gatherhold (Talenta Plains) and then they are organised from there.
We just found Toquill. He wanted a report. He said we may want to stop by the Great Library on Flamekeep and enquire about the Astral Sea.
Prince Orgath requested an audience with Elora.
Some other party got Conductor77. They are considering taking the bounty of checking the lightning rail on the Mournland. Whaling Barrow seems to be haunted. This other party wants to pay it a visit. It used to be a mithral mine. Some accounts say it was a burial site. They had a problem with the undead and they had to close it down.

The queen of Cyre is in Metrol, the “king” (prince) wants us to go look for her. Probably dead. Maybe turned to stone to stop them from being captured. Greater Restoration probably would heal them. There seems to be some crab “ethereal” creatures. Also strange spells.

Well, apparently the haunted cave was a ruse to get us into the cave. They wanted to kill RIP because he killed the husband of one of the bandits (he was one of the people that was holding Nordar prisoner). We killed two and the other two surrendered. Maybe RIP learned a lesson about forgiving a life.
