Elora tried to scry on Toquill. I think he failed willingly. We saw him washing some dishes in what looked like Dai’teag’s kitchen. He turned around, looked directly into the eye and said "should I make supper or breakfast?". RIP used sending to say "we’ll be there for supper".

On the way back to metrol we felt some giant crabs climb under the train. We fought them off and managed to kill them. Shortly after, a ghost train (like the echoes we saw before) goes through us. Some balls of lightning appeared and started accelerating the train. We almost died trying to kill them.

We finally arrived at Metrol, but it was super late already, so we said we would meet Toquill for breakfast.

Emily is Control! He knows everything. He also confirmed he is a dragon.
The epidiascope is linked to the Codex. The user of the epidiascope can view it and the information in it and make inferences. He wrote the note before the Mourning. He doesn’t know what caused the Mourning, but he thinks the Outsiders are connected to it.

The Creators took interest on a group of humanoids, and they bestowed the gift of magic on them. They made a great civilization, but there was a war after. The Quarry, invaders from the plane of nightmares, enslaved the races (elves). Finally, the Quarry was defeated with the help of the gods, but a continent was destroyed in the process, even a moon. But a clean cut from the outer plane was achieved.

The elves started to spread, and took with them the magic. Other races were flourishing too: orcs and goblins. Also magic, but a bit darker. This time, the plane of madness got involved. The dragons decided not to get involved this time. 

Then the humans moved in. There was still a connection with the plane of madness, though. Part of it was still linked, making the world unstable. Toquill thinks the Mourning was a symptom of this sickness.

After leaving, we decided to check the Palace of Shadows, but a tight security operations policy meant we didn’t manage to get through the doors labelled with the name of each nation.
We decided to go to the Palace of Flame instead, maybe we can find something there.

We found an invoice for 2000 gp, addressed to Caebrek & Daughter Expeditions, 12 Ash Warf - Stormreach. My family! I also find a plan for the warforged colossus. Three colossus 20th Ollerune 995, one at Barrenkeep (to attack the capital of Darguun), one at Kalzart (to attack Vathinroth), last one at Fort Bright (to attack a Karnath border town).

Back in the Palace of Storms, we found the library. In there I noticed one of the tables was occupied with paper and books, with what appears to be the journal of the archmage. 
He starts talking about the events on the day of the Mourning. There was some sort of magical event to the south west. He was woken by his assistant. They thought it was coming from Making. When they tried to contact people there, no response was received. They prepared everything for the contingency plan. This is when he polymorphed himself into a beholder to petrify the queen and her guards. Some other people tried to protect the tower and one cast banishment on the beholder, which only lasted a few seconds as the caster instantly died. He didn’t die. However, he couldn’t drop the polymorph, so they stayed in that state. The de-petrification vials were destroyed in the Mourning, so he couldn’t restore the court.
After some time, the dead started to rise as mourners. He continued work on the mage-bred humans, to help him take back control of the city. The first successful experiments were involving necromancy and growing hosts every 5 or 6 days. They needed human prisoners to give consciousness to the beings. They lived a short life of only a few weeks.
He talked about how they could be used to replace the warforged, liberating them from their debt to Karnath.
He started using rats as the consciousness, which lived longer, but were less active.

Able did some research on the Astral Sea, how it felt being there. Not much was found, as not many people go there.

As the night fell, we went back to the telescope. We noticed that the 13-slot wheel was for each of the moons (one was blank). When switching the setting to shard, the plane is seen. We discovered this when Able looked to the eye symbol and saw the plane of madness. She went mad for a bit.
