More work on Meriele’s sword:
Lan: Creating the blade
Creeclan: Cleanse the blade
Quenching of the sword

We had a rest and went to the tower first thing in the morning. Elora kind of introduced me to her mother, who isn’t fond of small races, apparently. We’ll see how that goes...

Telescope control values:
Aperture: cloud with lightning bolt
Tracking: off
Ascension and declination: ?
Normal/Shard: ?

We’re now on the train and started moving. We’ll drop the queen on the border and get back. Lysee d’Sivis told us some Canith people will be there too.

Some creatures jumped on the train as we were leaving Metrol. We had to fight them alongside the guards. Very nice to have more people with us.
