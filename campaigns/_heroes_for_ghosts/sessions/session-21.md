Adrik said bye to Meriele. Does he feel something for her?
We arrived at the place where the eggs Sas needed were. We got the eggs without killing the dinosaurs. Great. Now weâ€™re onto the basilisk. We have to kill it and take some oils from its stomach.
We fought some creatures on the way in and finished being ambushed by a group of squids.
