King Boranel is preparing alliance with Darguun goblins
Captain Brigim is in command of our company
Elvish woman: Identified herself as "C". TOP SECRET:
General Nodar (Darguun woman) ally.
Kaegan (Nodar’s nephew). Kind of a noob. He should be rescued lest Thrane or Cyre find out about this high profile prisoner.

Orc prisoners have been taken by another group that killed the Thranish unit. Other group has tattoos (not a dragonmark). It looks like house Deneth’s dragonmark (mercenary), probably work for them. Operate out of Karnach.
Message from elvish woman: "Message received and understood. Please, proceed and recover prisoner if possible. Kaegan: Shortish orc, brandings of daggers on forearms."

After the fight, Bard captain was left alive (he cast invisibility on himself).

As we were fleeing, the Mourning happened. We were rewarded with the Medal of the Iron Claw. We got a military pension of 30 gold.
