The two men we recovered were attacked by a sea monster. Was it the merfolk that attacked us? Apparently the one that was conscious disappeared after the fight. No one has seen him.

The Redpull incident in 84. The merfolk attacked a ship because the crew had to eat a mermaid. Things didn't go well for them.

Varhoe turned into a bear apparently! He brought a deer carcass with him, probably to ear.

Zarantyr and Dravago are both full moons right now. Maybe it's just a once a month thing.

Finally, the captain was bitten during the fight, so he's been chained to the ship to avoid him turning at night and attacking the crew. He was OK, so RIP cast Remove Curse on him and he was then free to walk around.

The Silver Flame don't like Varhoe's condition. They persecuted lycanthropes. Varhoe is a werebear then.

Shardfall was an event in Xen'Drik. Like a piece of the sky fell to the continent. Able stopped one as it was falling. 3885 gp. Wow!

Two storm giants riding the back of orcas showed up demanding tribute. Abel gave them a part of the shard.

They kept coming every day until they showed up with a dragon turtle! We had to fight as they were outrunning the boat.

We finally arrived at the jungle and started hearing some whispers about "Axe Bearer" and "Old Father", something about a prophecy. They call ME the "Old Father"!
"We are the Adra-kesh" They spread through the entire continent because of the prayer Adrik said. Something about the "Tree Trumplers". They're bigger. Giants? They are apparently "hunting for the kin of the Old Father". Working for my family?

- Adrik: Old Father, Axe Bearer
- Able: The Ancient One, small like a sapling but ancient like an oak
- Elora: The Riddler, 
- RIP: The Silent One, the Wise

Then the giants appeared.
