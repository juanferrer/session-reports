We fought the few that broke in. Two groups:
Two townies that were hired (10gp) to write "Free Elementals PP"
Three thugs that went downstairs for something.

One of them showed us a tattoo about the monster nation west of Breland. It is used by the Dashk gang, a crime organisation that's been growing in the last decades. They came to steal a spherical shiny object. The object was to be taken into a cart outside. We can find the one we talked with in the Terminus district and ask for Conny.

The Clustered Planar Annihilation Device (CPAD) is what they came for. It would knot the universe and rip a whole in it. It sucks everything into the vortex towards the astral plane.
The boss of the thugs has a metal rod: Pod of Collapsing. Moton (Short/Collapse) and Gujat (Long/Extend).

We looked for the woman that made the initial offer in the tavern she was in, but had not been there since. We did get intel that she had been seen in the Terminus district (same as Conny).

Excited Duck is the tavern where the Dask may be. The Arms of Steel is run by a very racist dwarf (female). She pointed us to the tavern above.
A half-orc (male), Bellubar, is the barman. He was under the influence of a Geas spell. We paid 90gp for a remove curse in one of the facilities of the Jorasco house.
Nodar, the Darguun general, was the commander of Belabar. She came to the bar with two other women and, after failing to recognise him, cursed him and left.
