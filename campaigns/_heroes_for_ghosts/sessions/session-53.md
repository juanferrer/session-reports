We started swimming away and the turtle appeared. Elora cast wall of force into a dome, trapping the turtle inside it, not allowing it to follow us.

We ran into the forest and hid for a while. My mother told us that the Witches would be expecting us with the three items (the armour, the mask and the scythe).

Abel examined the mask and thought it could be activated with some time messing. After several loops (not sure how many), Abel arrived into the time chamber and found the activated mask already there. 

Camp is full of giants, very well armed. 70 or so dwellings, over 100 there.

The base of the volcano is barren and full of ashes. We find a passage dug into the side of the volcano. There seems to be some activity on two platforms near the entrance. They are digging something?

The warforged-like creatures on top of the platform said he is the "Provo Doll"(?), the commander maker. These creatures seem to be pre-emancipation warforged.

Lidus, Rigva and Nexpo.Tylos is the one in the hut. These are the "masters".

RIP started talking to the warforged and convinced them to make themselves free. Their master, Tylos, showed up and we started a fight after Abel dropped a 400lb chainset on him. He almost died. We ended up killing him afterwards.

We freed all of the warforged and they're not fighting with us. We killed the other one, with Adrik dealing 113 damage and Brlian dealing the killing blow.
