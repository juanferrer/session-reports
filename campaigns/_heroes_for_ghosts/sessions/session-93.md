After a long wait, the butler came back inviting us into the kitchen, but we stopped in the dining room, as they had guests there. Shava was nowhere to be seen. Elora ran all around the house calling for her mother, but she couldn't find her. Eventually, she found her in the kitchen, where the butler had been. We played along for a bit, but I think she knows we know… After the cake, she ran off to the kitchen, where Elora followed her. Elora used Dominate Monster on Coteh and asked her to dismiss the guests so they could have some time alone.
After they left, Elora ordered her to reveal her true likeness, and we saw her in all her hideousness. She also told her not to use her mother's image. And then the combat started

We had a very intense combat, but I think we worked very well. Abel opened with a globe of invulnerability, which protected her, Elora and myself. The guests came back just as Elora cast slow, leaving most of them looking ridiculous. They were all affected by different spells: RIPs sunbeam, Abel's synaptic static and Elora's slow. Oh, I accidentally destroyed part of Shava's dining room with erupting earth, I'll pay that back. Anyways, one of them went all suicide on us and cast fireball on everyone, nearly killing herself. I proceeded to decapitate Coteh. On the killing blow, I turned around, threw my axe to the one behind me. Using my arcane charge, I teleported next to her , caught my axe and continue attacking. It was epic. RIP absorbed the soul of one of them and used the others to heal Abel and Elora. They got destroyed.

We found a locket on Coteh's body. Inside there was an eye, looking inside into some batteries. We wanted to take off the batteries, but were afraid the locket was a dead-man switch or something.

Elora took a slower tour of the house and it is indeed a very nice house.

Abel checked the magic items we've been gathering. The locket was a divination proxy.
The hourglass had text in a different language saying "Contingency" and then 13 numbers on the opposite side:

```
5 13 11 7 2 3 3 10 9 4 6 12 1
```

We'll have to check if this is for the epidiascope.
This is what it said: "If the first should fall in the seat of the bear then the giant from the mists shall return from the sea on wings of flame."

After a full night's rest, we went to meet with Able's bro. He was staying with the re-forged (Sachem, Lord of Blades). BB was there too. He sold the ship we salvaged. Hopefully he can take us to Lharvion.
Sachem explained all the work they had been doing and how they had reached out to the Giff to get mining contracts and stuff. Abel also mentioned them setting up a manufacturing plant in Eberron and have stuff delivered almost instantly after order. They took notes.

Amaron, Able's brother, invited us for dinner, although RIP cooked, so I guess we invited them for dinner. Sylaris (girlfriend/fiancée) told us about braindaddy. She talked about the past, when Githyanki lived on Eberron. She mentioned a greater conscience (about 20k years ago, after the giants).
The world was greatly connected, they would feel other consciences around them (due to their telepathy), the thoughts of all living things.

But they changed it all  (who?). Githen ("our Eberron") was changed. Their stories say that when the cataclysm happened, very few survived. Only those in the Astral Sea did, and they were not able to go back to Eberron (due to the ring of Syberis). They escaped to the moons.
Illithyds are githzerai that were changed by the madness of Xoriat. Then the war started.
Three of the Daelkyr travelled to Eberron. The other four were captured in crystal prisons.
She warns that they changed Eberron once. They can do it again. And we may be the ones cast out this time. One (two, actually) are roaming the land. We need to stop them from changing Eberron.

They cannot be killed outside of Xoriat. She didn't know of a way to kill them. She mentioned their elder's at the Grove could know more. Abel remembered reading about it in the letter from Salmon.
It's a station in the moon Rhaanis where it's located.

BB said he can get us to Lharvion in 1.8 days (18 Eberron days). He said something has been happening in the area around it. People going crazy, more githyanki ships and stuff.
Abel suggested the cloud of madness in Lharvion may be connected to the Mourning in some way. Apparently the cloud started expanding around the time Amaron arrived in the Astral Sea (exactly the day of the Mourning). Hmm…
