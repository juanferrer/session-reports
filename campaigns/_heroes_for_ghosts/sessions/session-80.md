As we left the city walls, we were met with the scorching heat of Fernia. In the sea of lava there were sort of paths that we could walk on. On the one were were walking on we saw two collapsed humanoids that were carrying a cart. We checked them and one of them was dead. The other one was barely conscious. They were the slaves of some Githyanki trader called Kas'a'lac.

After some discussion, we kind of freed the giff, Jarrow, who killed the Githyanki. We threw him and the poor orc to the lava and carried on towards our destination.

We arrived and made it seem like we came instead of Kas'a'lac. They received us and took us to a room to discuss business. We asked to see a demonstration of the product and they took us to see Kifu. We were then led to a fight room.

They put the armour on a slave and had them fight a fiery octopus. The lizardfolk looked out of his depth. But the octopus couldn't do anything to them.

We got to talk to him after it and he spoke about other weapons he used for demonstration. He said it looked similar to the armour, so we can assume it was also made of Fernyxium.

After a while, Elora and Abel started wandering. They went to the room we passed on the way in and the sign said "Legend Making". They were writing a bunch of stories about different things, but Abel read one titled "Heavenly Champion". It talked about a finely crafted longsword engraved with the symbol of one of the Sovereign Hosts (Law domain). Supposedly a key to opening the tomb of Hamubai.

Anyways, as we kept going we were stopped by two fire dwarves. They told us to get back but Elora managed to sneak past them.
She found the foundry and a warehouse. There was some type of big warforged moving stuff along.

Elora found a cart that was hanging from the ceiling. It was connected to a railing that was controlled by a panel. We jumped in and went along with the cart.

We reached a room where one of the fire dwarves was working. We started hearing a hum as we got in. There was a machine with a big button. I pressed it and a tuning fork came out and a hammer hit it. That made the humming louder, which made us notice it came from Elora's Cul'Strat. She struck it and gained an ability there.

One of the machines was working on an item with a scroll. I'm sure that was one of the scrolls the Legend Making guys wrote. I think this is actually turning the fiction into fact. They modify reality to turn the legend true.

Anyways, we went through to the next room and entered the foundry. I couldn't get back on the cart, so I had to run after it. The fire dwarves saw me, so I hid outside until RIP cast silence so I could go past them as they went to look for me.

And then we barged into the anvil room. Kifu was working on it here. There were chains in the room, we think these are the "chains that bind". He wasn't happy to see us, so we had to fight him. As we got close, RIP cast create food and water on top of a pot of liquid metal. The explosion killed him, Elora-Rex and myself! That was ugly. The explosion also broke one of the chains.
