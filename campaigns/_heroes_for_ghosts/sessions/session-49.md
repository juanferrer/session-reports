The female was Salomon, one of the witches.
They are taking my parents to Amber. Got a plan.
Parents went back to the old country. Tishy was studying the Greengate, the Cul’Sir runes that the giants used for encoding. Magrus died, she dealt with it along with Brommar. She uncovered some of the keys, and left an encoded message.
She thinks the place we are in is like a power station. This place is called Indigo.

The inverted pyramid on top of the pillar is called a chromatic calculator. It controls the power station.
They are looking for some devices, Lacey thinks they are in these places:
- Ocular device: Aqua
- Shield: Cadmium
- Instrument: Verden

We took some concoction to increase our perception, activated the machine and felt like we were also inside the pyramid, floating in there. 
We had some trippy experience with colours and incredible

We ended up activating the machine and, after going through the tunnels, encountered some stone giants on the exit leading to Henge/Twins.

“Fina Avichevaina” is “awaken” in giant. We’re gonna play baby giants coming from the “real world” (as they believe they live in a dream and they will awaken when they die). We will try to tell them the awakening is happening and they can awaken themselves when they’re ready. We crit on the “Fina Avichevaina” screaming!
The plan kind of worked. They didn’t kill themselves, but they started fighting with each other and they were very easy to finish off. Very successful planning, I think.
