- Lock: Chain back
- Fire: Fire the cannon

Captain Greenbottle had some romance with a friend/relative/significant other of Elora? She is very keen on talking with the captain about every story of this woman.
A stowaway got in and broke a magic item (mistaking it for a drug?) that was keeping 4 creatures as statues (a toad, an alligator, a snake and an owlbear). We killed the toad, destroyed the alligator and a snake and Able cast levitate on the owlbear and threw it off the ship.

The captain and a lot of the crew died or were left incapacitated, so we're taking some of the roles in the boat. I'll be the boatswain, which takes care of the structure and care of the boat.

Ceiling is broken and the side of the boat rib of the ship is damaged. Need to decide on materials and what to do.
We need to fix the side of the boat first, lest water starts getting into the boat. I will try to get some hay (probably was around the statues) and put it inside some sort of cloth. I will try to cover it with wood afterwards.

After a while, we spotted some pirates attacking another ship. We're going to their rescue with a damaged ship and half a crew. Great odds!

We fight them and beat them. We invited most of the crew to our boat and got some loot.
