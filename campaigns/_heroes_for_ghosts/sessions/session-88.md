While in the cemetery, the devils that were under Abel's employment showed up to say bye and gave her a gift. Tome 1 of 37 of Daanvi, a Guide to Its Laws, Etiquette and Customs.
As we went back to One Good Tern, we noticed the sign in my parent's shop dropped the "Daughter". It's now Caebrek Clan Expeditions and Artefact Recovery. They said it's because they want to be more inclusive, as now I'm part of the family. How sweet! We arranged a dinner with my parents and continued to the tavern to get some rooms. Elora got some clothes and a sword for her mother.
RIP used sending to ask Ellie to meet us in Metrol.

Shava told Elora that there is an impostor in her house. There's a spare key in a loose rock in the fountain in the garden.
She also mentioned a secret passageway to hear conversation in Control's room. Accessible from the second servant's bedroom. Not the one nearest to the road, the second one. Need to light the left hand everbright lantern, turn the knob 90 degrees.

We had a wonderful dinner with my parents. Mum cooked my favourite dish, but used a different type of fish. One recently familiar: mermaid. But she cooked it wonderfully. Delicious all around. We also discovered that they've been suppressing some of the most important plot points, so it looks like we're just thrill seekers looking for the next adventure. Meh…

The next morning we got a call from Lycee d'Sivis. She asked us what had happened in the Dreadhold. We explained that we had hired an alt team. Apparently chaos follows us. Oops. We asked her to help us get back to our ship and she said she would make a few calls.

We discussed some options with Shava and she said she would give it some thought.

Lycee discussed options with Kundarak's house head and offered our help in exchange for Krona Peak's teleportation circle's glyph. We accepted, so we're going to deal with the eldritch beasts that the alt team freed. And we will be heroes. How ironic!

Finally, Shava told us she wants to work with Lycee. They both discussed the situation and agreed on an arrangement. We sent her to Sharn and she will travel from there to Trolanport.

Krona Peak is one of the wonders of the world. The city has been there since before Galthar came to Khorvaire, thousands of years old. The Bazaar of the Four Winds is the largest open market in Eberron.

Apparently Radrop broke into the bank. The vault is closed.

We dropped by Jorasco Enclave. They're still running. They're not willing to sell us anything, so…

We dispatched Shava to Sharn. We got a shield device my sister found, said our goodbyes and teleported to Krona Peaks.

We are now in Krona Peaks. Always wanted to visit! Lovely place. After being received by Holfran, we chatted with him a bit and went on to visit the market. We were next to the Great Hall of the Council in Krona Peaks. The leaders that run the different principalities were there. We moved onward through the massive doors into the open street, towards the busy market.

We all went off to explore. I went looking for a good smith. One that was not terribly old. Someone that knows what they're doing, but also is willing to learn and experiment. I reached Anvil Crafts. There I found Kaerra, which was working on some other piece. We talked for a few moments and then I showed her the fernyxium axe head I got in Fernia. She had never seen it before either. I offered her the opportunity to be one of the first people in Eberron to work with this metal. She was thrilled. I showed her a design I had been working on of the Caebrek's sigil. She said she would try, but I would have to leave it with her.

Abel got many things, a few attunement forks among them. RIP got a pair of winged boots for Elora. And I also got a +2 shield.

We went back to the ship and summoned Krek, Abel's alt, to get a retelling of what happened and get our sending stone back. Oh, and I guess we have to pay her…
She said it was one of the guards that pressed the buttons that released the creatures.

We met Rogda d'Kundarak, the new captain of the guard in the Dreadhold. He debriefed us on what needs to be done and the current situation. They've retaken red, gold and stone wards, but deep ward is still infested with monsters. Hriggala and Yeenoghu are their names.

**Hriggala**: Demon lord. Squid-like tentacle monster-thing. Resistant to cold, lighting and fire. Immune to non-magical attacks. Immune to charmed, exhaustion, frightened, paralyzed and poisoned. Extremely strong on most stats. Not very intelligent. Can raise undead minions.
**Yeenoghu**: Werewolf-gnoll thing. Damage resistance to cold, fire, lightning. Immune to poison and non-magical attacks. Immune to charmed, exhaustion, frightened, poisoned. Strong on STR, CON, WIS. Weak on DEX, INT, CHA. No magical abilities, just plain dangerous.

Magical system has been shut down. They're figuring out what happened.
Room in the lowest level. Before the prison was built. Before Galathar the Great came here. It's what powers all the magical systems in the prison. They don't know what happened. They want us to have a look at that as well, so that the creatures can be contained.

We then left and spent the night in the inn next to the Dreadhold. Hopefully we can get our brooms back in the morning.
