We went to talk to General Nordar. She is with her troops at the border of the Mournland. We know three colossus are near the area, so we will also be trying to find and destroy them.
She wasn't keen on us destroying them just yet.

We made a contract with Merc d'Cannith. He will tell us how to locate and destroy the colossus and in exchange he will get to study RIP for a month within 6 months.

Warforged brain in the head. Can be destroyed.

Guy was very passive-aggressive. Didn't like him one bit…

Also, apparently he knows there are more colossus, so we can't waste time.

We decided to head into Making to try to find Norr.

As we were going there, Control called to tell us that Karrnath had crossed the river into the Mourning, so Breland and Darguun have followed. A war is about to start.

Fey spire? The Ice Castle. The Daughters contacted Control. They told her that horrible consequences will come from there.

*"If the day comes when spire of The Book freezes forest four years without thaw the incarcerated lord will be freed. Only on The Anvil may the chains that bind be broken."*

Next month is when the four-year period completes. Oof… We're always short on time. Not sure what the Anvil is for if the lord is freed after the fourth year.

We finally reached Making and saw the colossus. The Reforged were almost ready to go, so we offered our help to speed up the process. Sachem showed us all of the internal workings of the colossus. We found the warforged brain.

I think Abel found a way to ping the other colossus. Elora also used detect thoughts on it. She found that it had a connection with 9 other colossus. Are the other 4 destroyed? Or have they been activated? She also found that the colossus had self-awareness. Kind of like a dog.

We are going to try to create a body for the colossus' consciousness.

- First RIP managed to find a way to direct the consciousness and isolate it from the rest of the body.
- Elora found some spare parts.
- Abel assembled a body for the brain.
- Abel detached the brain from the colossus while RIP used Death Ward to keep it from dying
- Elora took the brain to the body with dimension door
- RIP cast regenerate on the brain while Abel was attaching it to the new body

…

Then Norr awoke in its new body. Elora told it to "find [its] friends" and it took off. Abel cast disintegrate on the head of the colossus husk and we started chasing Norr. It made it to Kalazart and found another colossus in the dead forest nearby. Abel used disintegrate again on this one.

So far, we've taken care of the following colossus:
- Norr (Making)
- Tymber (Kalazart)
We're now going north, to the border with Karrnath. Hopefully we can find another one there.
