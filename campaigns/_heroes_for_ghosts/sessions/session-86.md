After disposing of the bodies we found ourselves a laundry cart and fit in as best as we could. At around 6:30, we set off towards the Red Ward. Down into the workshops and to processing through the courtyard.

As soon as we entered the courtyard, one of the guards stopped Iron and we had to kill him. We got discovered, so we may have to do somethingâ€¦
We killed the three guards, hid the bodies back in the workshop, set some tables on fire and we hid in the elevator shaft. Close call.
Anyways, the guards left, set the floor on lockdown and told Iron to clean the place up. He kind of went out to give burnt wood to one of the guards to deal with it. Guard wasn't taking orders from a warforged, so he told it to do it himself. He was more colourful. Iron replied insolently too and the guard tried to stun him with the baton. Guard grabbed the wrong end of the baton and stunned himself. Iron walked out and now we have an excuse to go through the other door (taking out the wood!). Which we did. Krek and Apex got into the bag of holding and Zidor hid in the basket.
And we got through!

We went to the male block searching for a place to get out of the bag and plan. In the showers we found Ratrop!
I explained to him that we were there to free a prisoner and could take him with us. He had heard Diabra, from the female, had a gold card on her. We went to her with the plan to convince her to give us the card for the Gold Ward. While searching the block, we found some drugs and planned to blackmail her with framing her with stealing drugs from the dealer. In the end we also threatened to leave her with the dead guard in her cell. She pulled the card out of her prison wallet and we stashed the guard in an empty cell.

We went down into Gold Ward with the same trick and Ratrop guided us to Zorg's "cell". More like a palace. Anyways, he wasn't happy to see me, but we needed his help so we offered a bunch of magic items and my apologies. He accepted and told us about a deeper ward.

Zorg told us about an air shaft that goes from Gold Ward to Stone Ward. People that have been down in Stone Ward have said they have seen another air shaft going farther down. Apparently that goes to a secret ward, the Deep Ward.

East of elevators, shaft to stone ward. On the opposite side of that, there is an air shaft for the Deep Ward. He says if this prisoner is here, it's going to be there.
