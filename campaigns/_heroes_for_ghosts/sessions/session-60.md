We renamed the ship "The Duckess". We changed the figurehead to be a flying duck. Elora noticed the old figurehead (a gryffin) belongs to House Jorasco. We think it was going to be on the head of the house. Zorlan d'Cannith kind of knows one of us is dragonmarked. We may tell him it's RIP, not sure yet.
RIP also contacted Calla d'Jorasco, to see how she was doing. Got a response, we'll see what happened to her.
Brellacaine (Abel's friend, from Caine and Abel), is now leading a movement to provide alchemy supplies at an acceptable price.
We got our supplies and went on our happy way.

Some news on the paper:
- Tensions high between Breeland and Karnath with King Kraus accusing King Borenal of kidnapping his cousin. Korth demands to know why the Cyre monarch has not been seen since her supposed rescue. A place spokesman in Wroat said "Queen Dannel is recovering well from her ordeal and hopes to join her son in New Cyre as soon as she is able"
- Outrage over Jorasco price hike: 50% increase in all Jorsco services and products. House spokesman says "Regrettably the house has had a difficult year and has no choice but to pass on rising costs to the consumer - the house calls on the nations to support them in this difficult time". Sharn resident Ms Baeramore (from lower Terminus district ) said "it's them Cyrean refugees getting all the free healthcare and said now the Mournland is opened up they should go back home and stop taking free
- Hit Scry show Mourning Glory continues to top the rating as they close out their second season - but will they stay there now they have left Xen'drik? According to House Sivis their latest episode which featured a nail biting fight with the so called sisters broke all previous view figures.
 - In other news Sas Ciladan Dinosaur Hunter has hit back after his show was cancelled following his entire crew being killed and consumed by a pack of raptors. The lizardfolk guide denied being high on toad and negligent putting the crew in harm's way.
 - Sas claims his show will be back bigger and better than ever for his second season T-Rex on Tour which has been picked up by rival service Oricast.
- No evidence for concerns over startup Oricast. Hot on the heels of House Sivis Scry Box, House Orien (known for their lightning rail, stagecoach and mail service) is set to launch their own news and entertainment network later this month. House Sivis spokesman wished them well and said "I am sure the rumours of Oricast devices being used to spy on people in their own homes are as untrue as the actionable claim that they steam open letters entrusted to them for delivery to read their contents." 
 - Followed by an advert offering half price Sivis message station with this coupon (only 25 silver) the fastest and most secure messaging system in Khorvaire.
And one for Scry box for 49.99g with a 48month 5g/m subscription

RIP messaged Control about the queen of Cyre at the bottom of the sea. She told us to come to Wroat, because "we have a problem". Oh, no… We'll stop by on the way to The Great Crag.

Went to a stripclub where we heard a warforged was performing there. RIP was not impressed. But at least one of the proto-forged discovered their vocation.
Then we went to the library to research the astral plane and awakening the Cul'Sir items.

d'Cannith was expecting us for dinner at his villa by 8pm. We told him about RIP.
He was fascinated by the dragonmark. He said it doesn't look like a regular aberrant dragonmark. It seems to have the abilities of all houses.
Zorlan suggested we speak to the Baron of the Lyrandar house about getting info on flying etiquette.

After a call, he offered to give us an "official pilot" from house Lyrandar in exchange for us keeping the mark hidden. The pilot has had behavioural issues. Oh, great… Her name is Elly d'Lyrandar (Black Elly! The pirate!). We should either bring the ship (The Orkan) back or destroy it. It's equipped with two wands that can be disabled with anti-magic fields.

Elora scryed on Sachem. He was in some tent speaking to other warforged, apparently still in Making. They dug up the colossus. This could get ugly…
RIP used the mark sending to communicate with Toquil, who was already outside to talk to us.
Toquil (and his colleagues!?) are all impressed by RIP's dragonmark. He mentioned something about the realigning of the prophecy.

Toquil also thinks the Daughters are heavily involved in the aligning of the 13th moon.

He said "If you're ever in danger, step to the door through the clouds." What does that even mean?

The Sisters are maybe working with/for some ancient beings: The Lords of Dust, powerful at a level beyond anything seen in Eberron.
