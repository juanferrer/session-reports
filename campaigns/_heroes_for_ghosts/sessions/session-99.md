After recovering our breath, we carried on with the "interviews". We found Elaine. She was making something out of clay. She said it was Zachim. She said we will need to come back when the sculpture is finished.
We found the one that needed winding up and met Mara. She was able to disappear in the shadows. Literally. Lucienne was in the next room, much to our surprise. She shared some details about the first unveilings. It has to be performed in the slaughterhouse. The door must be opened with the offering, but then put together inside. She recited the following poem:

> *Upon the butchers' cold domain she lay,*
> *Buttercup, torn, where shadows prey.*
> *Sinister stitches, needle's dark embrace,*
> *The portal opens, Rimmin's chilling grace.*
> **
> *Buttercup's eyes, lifeless, yet alive,*
> *On the butchers' table, shadows thrive.*
> *Stitch swiftly 'fore the creatures bite,*
> *In Rimmin's realm, eternal night.*

She said Buttercup is not whole. She's currently in the butcher's table. Abel thinks she's a cow.
In the last room we found Ylara. She wanted some star charts. She suggested we find Cedric, the Mirror Seeker.

And with that, we left back to Eberron for a rest. We had a nice meal, I wrote some letters to my family and Meriele and then went to bed.
The next day we had a shopping session in Krona Peaks, Elora created Babel and we got ready to go back. Of course, after a heroes' feast and a good night's rest.

Aaand we're backâ€¦ head first into a fight with the nurses again. It was a walk in the park. Elora almost dies, though.
Seraphine told us that Jedra was in the Hall of Mirrors (in the central garden). We continued to the Surgery and had a short rest right before going in. In there we saw a few people. There were two doctors discussing how to stop the Singer from singing. We can't have that. So, again, we rushed in to save the patient from the doctors.
Finding nothing of interest in the current room, we moved on and found the surgery, with two operating tables with humanoid remains on them. We drew the circle and the portal opened. We are ready to face Xos.
