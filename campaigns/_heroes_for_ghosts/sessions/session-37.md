We survived the fight. Elora and RIP came back after feeling they were petrified for two years, but it was only 2 rounds. We destroyed the ziggurat with one of the charges from the camp and went up the other hole.

After going out the door of the empty room out the hole, we opened the first door we saw. It led to a room made of flesh with a dwarf at the back, dead. Able went in with levitate, but Elora and RIP walked in, causing creatures of innards to appear, along with a six-armed woman. After fighting them, Elora and Abel were very low, so we decided to settle down for the night.

After some night insects, we woke up and left. We found one of the warforged that was with the previous group. He told us where the documents probably were, so we found the archive and searched, after fighting some chittering monsters. We got the documents with a list of house Canith properties, which is what we needed.

In the end we decided to go to the vault. We found a huge bone monster which took RIP and TPd to the back of the room. RIP cast banish on it, Abel used her portent to make it fail and it disappeared. We killed the other things in the room and used the rest of the time to prepare a charge for when it came back. Weâ€™re gonna destroy it.
