We followed NorrDog for a few hours taking shifts to give directions to the drivers. We passed a few cities on the way, silent as usual. Continued going north, saw Waekelake and the canyon around it. Massive rift. Although the lake was glowing?! The entire canyon is glowing purple. No vegetation around it. Very, very strange.

We helper NorrDog when it got stuck on the wrong side of the canyon. As we crossed we saw thousands of living spells (spheres of magical energy attached to specific spells).

Abel got on her broom and the insatiable tome and tried to capture one of the living spells. And she got one! Almost falls of the broom, though. She captured a silence living spell.

As we were searching, we saw a sand river flowing towards the canyon. RIP spotted some Karnathi undead soldiers in there. Continuing upstream we saw the colossus buried up to its waist and a part of the Karnathi army trying to get on it.

RIP cast earthquake and many of them fell off a bridge they had set up to get on the colossus. It killed many of them, but the big guys were still up. As soon as we went in, the colossus started up. Elora put a wall of force between it and us.

I think it was the commander of the Karnathi unit, he threw a ball of necrotic energy to me. It almost knocked me out. It did, however, get the broom and Pan. We all started falling and Abel cast featherfall on us. The broom went into the sand river. I will try to retrieve it later. It's probably lost, though.

Elora did a free fall with her broom and catched Pan just in time and gave him a potion. Gotta protect our income! I blinked to the guy and started struggling with him. Abel got in the colossus, stunned the two operators that were inside it and turned the colossus around.

Things turned sour very quickly. In the fight with the knight I tried to push him off the cliff, but he was too strong and managed to resist. He then hit me with his sword and I was knocked unconscious. The next part was relayed to me by Elora and RIP. Elora was hit by the colossus. Swat, more like. She was killed by the hits, Pan took control of the broom and he then was also knocked unconscious by the colossus. They crashed on the sand just as RIP arrived.

Abel, just in time, destroyed the brain of the colossus and started trying to get out.

When I died, I was in a landscape, lots of mist and people. Then I heard RIP's voice calling and I was awake in the ship. RIP immediately went to take care of Elora.

Message from General Nordar: They found and destroyed a colossus northeast of Lyreten.

We also told them that we killed some of the Karnathi army.
