We met a dragon marked halfling(?) from house Ghallanda; Sas found him. He's retired, though, not part of a house currently. He will be taking some of the villagers away from the fight.

The mercenaries got to the village and we destroyed them. Adrik even killed one of them with their cool axe.

Pan, a reporter from Scry News, found a doll with a message "Find my owner" in his home in Gatherhold. I think this is irrelevant, but that's how he got here. He arrived just at the end of the fight hanging from his dinosaur. We set up an interview between Pan and Dr. Calla de'Jorasco. Also Ron, the magewright will testify and some of the villagers will also tell their stories.
