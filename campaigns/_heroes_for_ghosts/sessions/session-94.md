The Demon wastes is not really a country. Effectively, the Icehorn Mountains is the edge of the world. Beyond there is a wasteland full of horrors and some tribal barbarians.
We decided to just call Nordaar and see if she's able to intercept Salmon before she reaches the Ruins of Pelmarane.

We went be BB into the ship to go to the Lharvion. I started catching glimpses of strange visions and hearing discordant music.
Approaching Lharvion, we see why they call it "The Eye". It looks like a cat's eye, with the elongated pupil and everything. Very unsettling.
Looks very deserted. And corrupted. The vegetation is unnatural, like a merge of flesh and fungus.

The place was terribly creepy. RIP conjured a palace for us to stay in while Abel attuned. After a while, Elora, Amarron and I went on an expedition. I was looking for something for my poisons. Maybe from those tree-like things. It was clearly organic, although a bit leathery. Tendrils from the crown tried to reach for me, but they didn't touch me.
I cut into one of the roots and the tree started screaming! I was about to stop, but I guess trees also don't like when we cut them down. And it was only a root, so… I got it. Elora was seeing shadows and stuff.
When we came back, Abel said we were gone for 9 hours! They were about 20 minutes, from our point of view. No more expeditions!

We pushed through to the 24 hours. I got 2 levels of exhaustion. Pan was fine, though. He's taking something, that wasn't normal… Abel completed her attunement, so we're out of here…

…to the crag! They were surprised we were there so quickly. Only 5 days. What?! Have we travelled back in time?! Damn… Nordarr confirmed they were successful in their quest, but at a great cost. They killed Xos and captured Salmon. We arranged for Salmon to be imprisoned in the Deep Ward in the Dreadhold. He owed us a favour.

We delivered the corpse to the Daughters and had a rest. Surprising refresh, we cured both levels of exhaustion.

The next day I studied the flesh root for a bit, but was completely stumped. I managed to find a botanical tome in the Daughter's private library. After some more studying (and Elora's inspiration), I managed to figure out this could be used to make purple worm poison.

Control was unconscious, but herself. Elora tried to probe her thoughts on Vaster and her mind appeared to recoil at the thought. We decided not to traumatise her any further.

Right before leaving, we called Lycee, as we found out she had been keeping the disappearance of the Queen and Control under covers. We informed her of the situation and she said she would think of something.

Now onto The Grove! As we appears in Rhaan, a group of githzerai were moving some crates and got scared when they saw us. They thought we were fey, so we played along. They gave us a lift to the Grove!
The place was a strange combination of nature and technology, all with a fey motif.They docked the ship and we unboarded.
Sylaris came back with some guy called Zephyrath. An old boyfriend? Oof…

Around 10,000 years ago (astral time), the githyanki spread from Eberron to the Astral Sea. They loved it. They found beings, the outsiders (they came from elsewhere). Around 6,000 years ago (astral time) the first war broke out. They were unable to return to Eberron. The outsiders modified reality (Episiascope tech?). Being unable to contact Eberron, they fought back. The githyanki sided with the Outsiders. The githzerai became refugees in the Astral Sea. The Outisiders started focusing on Eberron, and then the Second War broke out (72 years ago). They captured a few outsiders and imprisoned them in the Grove. Three others were not localisable. Until a few months ago, a refugee from Eberron (Elora's dad), rescued from the Sea, betrayed his rescuers and was found communicating with the Outsiders. They decided to separate them, but the elf (Elora's dad) snuck into the ship carrying Quillion and freed him. That destroyed the ship carrying the Outsider and almost everyone died.
He gave us to book and pointed us to the final section of the second one, which might help us with the travelling to them. Whispers from the Abyss: A Descent into Xoriat, and (text below)

- Quillion: On the run
- Xos: Xoriat
- Jedra: Imprisoned in Eberron
- Vaster: Xoriat
- Vral'a'yak: The Grove
- Riman: The Grove
- Xakin: Imprisoned (location unknown to us)

We are guided into the chamber keeping Vral'a'yak and Riman, a large room with many magic protections. At the center of the room there was a large black obelisk, much like the one in the Dreadhold and other places we've been.

While in there, Zephyrath noticed a protection spell had been deactivated. We told him to get it activated immediately and he left looking for some manual. We thought something was up, so Elora and Abel activated their improved vision and saw a large, disembodied brain (daddy brain) and four mindflayers.
