They didn’t want to talk, so I pulled one of them into the wall of blades and attacked the other one. We all then tried to get RIP to harvest their soul.

After the fight, we had a look at the ship and noticed their hibernation pods or something. There were many cables inside the ship, kind of looked like a living thing. 
Elora cast Speak with Dead on the captain of the pirates.
He’s seen Abel’s brother on "Pasath"? "Pasath" is near Eyre.
Sarrak is the name of his boss.

Bebe asked us to kill the ship and take it with us for salvage. We got a deal with him for 50% of the value, which he said should be about 10k credits. We expect to be able to sell it in Phoenix station. While killing the ship, we found another githyanki inside a pod, apparently it was connected to the ship and died when disconnected.

While on the way, Bebe told us the pirates have been getting bolder and attacking more ships since the Lharvion event.

Next morning, a corpse hit the deck. Looks like an elf. Feminine in appearance. Bulbous skull and completely bald. Githzerai, according to Bebe. Turns out there was a debris field, probably from a Githzerai ship. Elora attempted to scry on Abel’s brother, but she appeared to be pushed away from him, unsure why.

We sent Pan back to drop off some tapes. We missed Elora’s birthday!
Varhoe is doing a celebrity travel show.
Queen Darnell (Control) announced that the reforged are getting the glass plateau. Huh…
Drooam gets recognised as an independent country by king Boronel (Breland). This is what the Daughters wanted.
Karnath says the agreement between Queen Darnell and the warforged is illegal. They say the warforged are terrorists.
The King of Karrnath is calling a summit to discuss the issue.
Karrnathian troops are going into the Mournland to deal with the reforged.
Sachem will march into Korth if another incursion enters the Mournland.

We finally arrived at asteroid 134M-8859-K664. It orbits Eyre at 1340-1388 miles every 2.4 days. No atmosphere, low gravity. RIP went to have a look around the asteroid, nothing there. We set up the teleportation circle. RIP told Sachem everything was ready and shortly after several warforged appeared in the circle.
22, which was with the first group, confirmed they killed the first incursion of Karrnath with the colossus. Oh, well…

We went back to space to find the capital ship where we thing Abel’s brother is. We reached the centre of the debris field and saw a huge ship that looked like a squid and was consuming the destroyed ship. Bebe recognised it as being one of the Githzerai’s largest ships. It was being consumed by the squid-shaped capital ship.

Bebe suggested we go dark and fly past the ship and we jump off towards the squid. Abel will be disguising us and we will cast Tongues on Elora.

So, we slept and got ready to jump. We jumped off, used the breathers and used the power of our thought. We managed to get in with the portable hole.

We went through, tricked most people into thinking we were githyanki, as Abel cast seeming to make us look like them. Abel is too short, so we were lucky it was bring-your-child-to-work day. Still, the one guarding the prisoners didn’t buy it, so RIP cast silence and we went to knock him out. Or at least I did.

Managed to knock him out while Abel looked through the cells for her brother. RIP killed the guy, though. We freed the two people in the cells just as Elora opened the door to the interrogation room.
We heard in our minds the line of questioning the two mindflayers were following on Ammaron, who was being tortured on a stretcher.
