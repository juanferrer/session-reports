We got a call from Zorlan d'Cannith. The good one, though. He said the general has taken his forces south of the Cyre river. They have managed to restore control to two of the colossus (we destroyed one).
Nordar also called us. She's too coolâ€¦ The Darguun army has secured two of the colossus. We gave her the location of the other three, she will retrieve those, activate them and meet us up north to fight the other colossus.

We also told her about the fey spire. She told us they usually anchor themselves for a few days or weeks and then return to Thelanis. She agreed to destroy the colossus she has if we manage to destroy the ones near Karrnath so that we can go north to deal with the spire and the outsiders.

We are very wounded, we need to rest and heal. Instead of following the Karrnathi army with Artorok, we will go to Karnslayer, destroy it and then go to Metrol and try to intercept them after having a short rest on the way.

We found Karnslayer in a donut shaped trench.

Here's the stuff I need to fix the broom.

- [ ] Engine requires a copper infused with Eberron dust (25g)
- [X] Landing skids is smashed
- [X] Torn casing
- [ ] Casing is ripped up (Mending?)
- [ ] Fix casing for elemental
- [ ] Get new elemental ring

I used the Zafu to get a good look at the colossus. It's crawling on the ground. It has no legs. It appears to have worn them down. Probably been doing this for the past 4 years. Poor thing! In it there are desiccated remains of 4 humanoids.
We decided to have me go there and have a look around and call Abel to destroy it. After seeing the corpses of the Cyrean soldiers I wanted to lay them to rest, but we need to deactivate the colossus first. I called Abel, she destroyed the brain and, after everything went quiet, I put the corpses down. They can finally rest.

We then started following Artorok and as we catched up with them, we saw the Karrnathi army had received reinforcements. We decided to engage them in a sneak/surprise attack. Elora will cast greater invisibility on herself, position 500 ft. above the colossus and wait for Abel to fall to catch her. Abel, in turn, will swan dive from the colossus, free fall until about 400 ft. from the head and then cast dimension door to get inside the head. RIP will cause a distraction (sunburst) to get as many of the undead as possible (most died) and I will drop one of the remaining arcane charges. Then Elly, Ozronnon, Pan and I chill on the ship.

After that, we left. Epic plan! First time it works.
