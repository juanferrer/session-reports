The Unseen Codex: Secrets of the Veil appears to be the key to the Second Unveiling. We have to draw a magic circle (diagram provided) and chang the following sacred words:

> *Enkaar althor serathor.*
>
> *Solaireth enthrak varoluth.*
>
> *Zireth luminar ulithor.*
>
> *Arsineh thuval kasrith.*

We found the index for the library. The other unveilings are in loan to each of the Daelkyr. So we will have to fight them to get them.

We ended up leaving the big library and back into the small library. The Librarian was angry we took the books without being members, so we had to fight him. During the fight, two orderlies showed up, so we had to kill them too. No bodies were left behind, though. Right before killing the Librarian, he reconsidered his loyalty to his work and decided against dying for it. At the end he gave us membership cards and allowed us to borrow the books. I also got the bookmarks!

We continued to the east wing and started knocking on cells.

Abel spoke with Irina, a woman we believe was The Collector (she was collecting invisible butterflies). She said she has been in the Surgery. She mentions there is a way to get back, which involves a circle and knowing how to unlock it. 5 aspects, flesh, metal, mind, magic, time. She showed her the circle and also mentioned Aria, the singer, was in the Surgery.

Elora found the One Who Looks Up, Evangeline. She was waiting for the moon to wax to recover her full strength. She also had no face! When asked about the Unveilings, she said speaking about that is forbidden. She mentioned Linda, from the chapels, knew more about it.

We went to see Linda. She was sobbing. The Weeper. She is mourning people. Not family, friends, or anyone. Just someone crying. She said Dalerak lives in the Chapel. We will need to come back, as it is not yet time to go into the Chapel. We asked her about others whoIlara, the Stargazer. Irina, the Seeker.

We found Control's room. Abel kept some hairs. We also found Aria's room, the singer.

After that, Elora spoke with Seraphine, who thought she was some kind of Queen. Goddess rather. When I asked her about Evangeline, she started freaking out about her being a farce, and the nurses were alerted. Elora and I hid in the room, RIP and Abel went to another room. Elora used Greater Invisibility, so they didn't see me. When the nurse arrived, Seraphine explained that her goddess had come to visit her. They then took her out of the room for treatment. I couldn't allow her to go suffer, so I rushed after her and cut off the nurse. Then, invisible as I was, I started attacking. And… it all went downhill from there. Bear in mind, we haven't been able to recover yet after fighting Vaster and the Librarian… Maybe this was too much.

But it turns out it wasn't. RIP cast anti-life shell, blocking the path of the other nurse and the orderlies. I dealt with the nurse in the lobby and teleported with the other three. Then Elora said to Seraphine "I bestow upon you my divine power to smite my enemies before me". A moment later, she cast Moonbean at 9th level. O.O She instantly killed the nurse and almost destroyed one of the orderlies. I killed the first orderly and Seraphine used Wish to send the last one to "treatment". Completely turned around the fight.
