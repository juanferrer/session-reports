We managed to get away from the temple. We also left the door to the vault open. We are about 4 days away from Stormreach. Varhoe had a map that was probably made by my sister! There’s also an Adrik’s Carn in the map. A place to visit.
We travelled through the jungle, run from some drow, befriended a tiger and arrived in Stormreach.
