We were a bit aimless without Abel, but managed to get to the Crab and chat with the Daughters for a bit. Elora called her mom and informed her regarding the restoration of Cyre. After that we left to Daanvi.

We arrived at Primegate and surprised the bots with all papers in order. In the Hellcienda we were received by Dix, the "horny" contact. He had been promoted and took us to the VIP area.

Everyone was there. And I mean, everyone. All our families, friends and everything in between. Even King Boranel was invited. Before we could approach anyone, Abel came to us and we hugged. We spoke for a bit and Hasanas gave his big speech. He confirmed the guy that had summoned her was Toquill.

Hasanas went through our story and the things we did. It was fantastic.

Elora shared some very emotive words as well.

Meriele brought a property catalogue for our tavern! We decided to go with Skogsh√§gnaden, in a forest near Metrol.

She signed a contract with Hasanas to become queen of Cyre. Just a few minutes after, Elora's parents informed her that she was not actually their daughter (nor was Meriele). It turns out that they had been tasked with raising them, as if it was known who their mother was, it would cause a riot. Their mother was Queen Darnell, so she was in line for the throne. Had she known 5 minutes earlier...

We spoke a bit with Zas, Varhoe, Bebe and Greenbottle.
Abel offered him a "contract" on the rights to travel between Eberron and the Astral Sea. She got him to sign a contract. She was born for this...

Hasanas told RIP about the dor'sil, a special dragonmark with a symbol for each of the other marks (the one RIP has). Dor'Sil is usually translated as Death Mark in common. This could be related to the reproduction thing...

Zorlan d'Cannith was eager to get a government contract to move to Making as soon as possible.

King Boranel welcomed Elora to the family.

Later that night, RIP cast insect plague on Abel's body.
