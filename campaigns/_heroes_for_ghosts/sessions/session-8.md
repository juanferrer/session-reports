We need to meet with Follie (Kelben's daughter) at the other side of the harbor, The Black Flagon (Dragon?). We need to help her take her father out of the city.

The Trust has the CPADs and they're trying to keep them from falling in the wrong hands. We may want to side with them for a while.

Travel options:

- Walk (3 weeks)
- Stagecoach (2 weeks): 38 GP each
- Airship to Zolanberg>Lighting rail to Sterngate>Groshk: 56 - 65 gp each


21 Ebon Street was a direction written in a picture Follie had (she was cryingâ€¦ =S). It's the address of a tailor. People from the Trust were outside when we arrived. 
We got into a Trust's building. We searched Kelben Lingenhall in the machine for Archive Search. The machine printed "Stored at L7.R275.3, 12.2.995YK" (date).
We went through the conveyor belt (with a lot of difficulty) and landed on the archive. We fought a warforged controlling a parcel sorting robot. RIP paralysed it and broke the fight.

The parcel in question contained Kelben's notes. Project Banshee Oblique is mentioned all over. We see pictures of two gnomes (male and female) from a few months before the Mourning. We also find a list of deployed CPAD. We escaped (after a tough fight) with a lot of Kelben's documents.
