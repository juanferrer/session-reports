We have an airship waiting for us at the Cannith facility. RIP arranged for us to get some ballistas. We plan to have Abel fit it to the brooms.
We continued towards Henge and found Twins, two detailed statues of giants that guard the entrance of a ruined city.

Have to bring the mask before Olarune is full (2 days). Have to get back into the lake, 400ft deep we will find the Aqua station.

Going down into the lake we found a giant complex with two wings. One of them had giants in them, the other one was flooded. We went through that one, avoided some aggressive fish, found a strange room with some timey-wimey stuff and had RIP disappear for us. Then we travelled back in time and almost repeated everything. Elora found where my mother was, got her with dimension door and woke up a dragon turtle that was guarding the place. I think we'll have to fight it now.
