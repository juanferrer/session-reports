The tree mentioned a creature with 6 legs? Probably a giant ant.
I grabbed 5 apples from Splitsprout, I want to plant them somewhere outside the Mournland and tell them their father’s name.
We saw Elora’s school and they turned into children (Adrik saved) and it was full of incorporeal children and a teacher. The date we saw was 23 Lharvion 887 YK. There was a critical thinking test that day.
Also, inspecting the cellars, we found some expensive spirits, which we are totally going to sell for profit. Mourning Whisky.
Arriving at the Dha’Iteag house, we found a tinkerer’s workshop. But we also found a letter to us! This shaman knew we were coming.
Also, many things we found. These numbers were at the back of the letter:

```
11 - 3 - 2 - 12 - 6 - 2 - 10 - 8 - 4 - 7 - 1 - 1 - 5
4 - 5 - 7 - 7 - 9 - 10 - 11 - 13 - 1 - 7 - 6 - 2 - 12
```

Also, "the original path"?
Toquill says something about being on "the Lamb", "Emily is quite a foxhound" and finding the "Prophetic Epidiascope".
Also, these are the books I found for smithing were:
"Heat Twice, Hammer Once: Methods for Careful Blacksmithing"
"Art of the Forge Ornate: Smithing Techniques for Swords and Daggers"

Steps for making the Meriele’s sword:
- Takah: Selecting of the Materials (steel)
- Meskah akah: Base forging (getting the alloy)
- Paskah: Folding of the metal (7 folds)

Going to the Palace of Storms, Able manages to see in the hood of one of the Watchers. Human face, but looks un-human. Yellowish, too smooth.
We blew up the Palace of Spirit and ran to try to get in.
