We need at least 12 Kg of the ore to make enough fuel to back up and running.

We will let someone know about the infestation in this station when we reach Sancus Station. It’s not very often that this happens, but they don’t seem to be a big problem for the integrity of the system.

We continued on towards Sancus Station. We all experimented with our legendary item, trying to discover more features.

The station was in an asteroid overgrown with plants. Strange, plants in space!

We went to the market in the station and we found some green meat. RIP’s gonna cook it for dinner.

We spoke to the bossman. Apparently Bebe’s come with people before. Some other people of "our kind" appeared four months back. They just appeared out of nowhere and they found them and rescued them. Some of them stole a ship, but they’re caring for the rest.

Bossman asked us to go and hunt some creature for its meat. Sounds strangely easy, so we’re also getting his stolen ship back. Abel thinks there’s a catch, so we’ll see.

We went to the place where they’re keeping the people, hopefully we can find Abel’s brother here. I really, really hope he’s not part of the group that stole the ship!

He was. He was leading the group. Oh, no…

Story time from Loden: They saw a purple-orange flash. Abel’s brother comes out with "the prisoner" and threatens to kill them, blaming them for . Some high value target, speaker’s not sure. Abel’s brother said there had been an explosion and they should destroy the CPAD.

During the procedure, some explosion happened, sounding like the world was torn apart. Then they woke up in the Astral Sea, with the gith already. The gith took care of them, but a lot of people died before arriving. Another group are also here, and they were recovered by the githzerai. The prisoner is with them. Abel’s brother went to find it.

The prisoner was not an elf nor an orc. Maybe human or half-elf. He’s not even sure it was a man or a woman. I think the prisoner is Elora’s father. A high-ranking Cyrean intelligence official would be a valuable prisoner. I think it’s him.

The unit commanded by Abel’s brother was instructed to extract this prisoner and take them to Breland, Zilargo or Darguun.

RIP cooked the green meat, which tasted like Tuna. A bit too sweet, though.

Gamba Ode, the bossman, told us where the tikka is. Olarune, then a portal to Lamannia ("the other Olarune"). He also gave us a map marked with the lair’s location… but it’s blank. Apparently it works only when in Lamannia. Good news is that the time there goes at the same speed as in Eberron.

On Abel's brother's front, we have no idea where he went. We’ll have to scour the Astral Sea to find him. But we’re going for the tikka first.

We arrived at Olarune, now we need to find the portal, which will be surrounded by small patches of vegetation. Once we find the portal, we need to "enter the right way", whatever that means.
