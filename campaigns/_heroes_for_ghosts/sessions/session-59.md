The moon connected to the plane of madness appeared to grow bigger. We got released when d’Sivis arrived and fought the remaining goons. RIP did an epic jump kill with sunbeam.

We found Tishnar in a hidden room, where she had been for a couple of days. Lysee took us back to Stormreach and suggested we actually settle the taxes with the stormlords.

Abel and I discussed solutions for my father’s legs. Finally I had dinner with my parents.

The next morning, RIP had another option. He cast regenerate on the leg. It regrew the bones, then tendons and veins. Finally the flesh and skin came on, but there was no hair or colour on it. Both papa and I fainted.

We went to see the stormlords. We settled the debt of 50k by mentioning some things we did for them:
- Cannith export taxes: 20k?
- Sivis offices: ?
- Tourism industry: 10k
- One item from Daanvi: 10k
- Returning adamantine: 6k 

We asked for my family’s debt to be written off.

Before we left, they requested help with a job when we have some free time in the future. Here are the details: 
Access to a site rich in mineral resources. Above average drow population. Some kind of holy site for them. False god resides there. Destroy whatever they worship there.

Essentially they want to exile the drow. Can keep items up to 100k total. No mineral is to be removed.
I don’t know how I feel about this.

We’ll be going to Korth with the proto-forged. 7 of them want to work for us in the airship. We got the sphere of annihilation and we’re on our way to speak with Zorlan d’Cannith.

We got our airship! Lovely brooms as well.

After having another look at the airship, it appears we won’t be needing (or having space for) the proto-forged. Oops…
