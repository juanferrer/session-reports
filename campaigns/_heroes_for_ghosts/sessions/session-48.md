Abel decoded the words on the cubic gate, which allowed us to open one of the portals. It will take us to some ruined platform, near Stormbridge, according to Varhoe.
Abel also licked the black pillar on the side of the main room. It was made of obsidian and, after casting detect magic on it, she discerned it was related to abjuration and conjuration.
We decided to continue and went through a room that had water in it. It started filling in and we were attacked by a water elemental. We managed to get to the other side, opened the door and found a pair of tesla coils that destroyed the elemental. We continued and went upstairs, where we found Lacey Omaren with another Adrik! There was also the continuation of the obsidian cylinder, which had an inverted pyramid on top.
I noticed he didn’t have my axe, so I challenged him to summon it, which he couldn’t. Turns out it was a female drow, but somehow special. Is this their queen? A soldier appeared and almost killed Lacey, but RIP managed to stabilise her.
The drow that was questioning Lacey was asking about how to activate some artifacts, one of them was the armour the soldier was wearing. I got the armour on and then Tishnar (my sister) showed up, threatening to kill Pan if we didn’t surrender.
