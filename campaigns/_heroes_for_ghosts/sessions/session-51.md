One of them was about to die, Solomon, the one that was taking my appearance. But they managed to escape at the last minute! With my mother and sister! They said "we have what we need".

Elora scryed on Solomon. She was talking to Tishnar about going "down" and her helping them "get in". They were in some giant ruins, maybe around Aqua. Probably around there.

The sisters want to use the items (including the armour) at the ziggurat, apparently for some ritual to reunite something. The plane of madness? Tishnar knows how to open the sites, so she was taken.

We decided to send my father through the cubic gate to Stormreach, to Lacey. The Omaren would take care of him until our return.
We also arranged with house Cannith (the good ones) to take over the Cul'Sir site in exchange for an airship that would be dropped off on Sharn at a later date.
Now we're headed to Aqua to hopefully find the other artifacts.
