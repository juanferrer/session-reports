We called our brooms to the ship, visited the manticore floor and then spent the night in the governor's office, drinking whisky and preparing for the next day.

We received three dragon shards to restore the power.

As soon as we left the lift in Deep Ward, we were attacked by an invisible creature. It was the Hriggala. Lots of tentacles and lots of teeth. It raised the corpses of the dwarves as undead and used an ability on me that made me want to eat it. Turns out my teeth are stronger than my axe! Hriggala was almost chomped to death. But alas, he dropped the spell.
Abel cast Feeblemind, so the creature started drooling with its tentacles in its mouth.
We decided to put it in a room, lock the door and come back to it when we're ready.

After checking the control room, we noticed there was a guard. He was limping and wandering around block B. We turned on the magic features of blocks A and C and came to check in on this guard. Elora noticed he didn't look right, as if he was "wearing" his skin. She shot him and it discovered itself. Another demon! They didn't mention this one. But RIP used banishment and that was that. It went back to its native plane. No one needs to know, they're not gonna miss it.

We found the corpse of Harak d'Kundarak. The governor! He was down here in the frontline. Didn't do him any good, though. Elora patted him down and found a set of keys to every door.

We prepared a plan where Abel would be bait and she would guide it into the cell. As usual, it didn't go according to plan. Abel almost died and RIP had to banish it. We decided to lock everything up and come back tomorrow. Dwarves weren't thrilled by the idea, but it's the best course of action. They also gave us a file with info on each of the prisoners in Deep Ward.

Elora went snooping and found the Governor's study.

They had a logbook of off-the-book prisoners.
- S (Sheva), requested to be held down in Deep Ward by C. No interaction.
- R (Ratrop), requested by head of house Kundarak. Robbed half a dozen Kundarak banks.
- E (Ervin, crazy match guy), requested by C.

Elora took her mom's file and destroyed it. She left the rest. She also found a teleportation circle. Very interesting.

As I was falling asleep, I received a sending. Kind ofâ€¦ More like a vision. Sora Katra was there. She was very alluring, very attractive. They have very important information for us. We need to see them.
