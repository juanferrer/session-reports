On the first day of travel we were ambushed by some dinosaurs. We fought them and killed them. When we camped, we got attacked again! By a lot of velociraptors this time. We killed some and they ran. On the second day we travelled for a bit and encountered a settlement of very friendly people. We shared stories with them and they invited us to spend the night there. There were some drugs involved, but in the end Able convinced Adrik that they were not drugs. They apparently make you think youâ€™re an animal. Or transform you into an animal. Amazing. On the third day, Sas offered to catch some eggs for a hefty sum of money. We made plans for a long time. We also executed them almost perfectly, but in the end Adrik got hit and fell unconscious on the zipline planned as the way out. Elora one-shot one of the beasts and Able killed the other one. Poor things, they were just defending their eggs.
