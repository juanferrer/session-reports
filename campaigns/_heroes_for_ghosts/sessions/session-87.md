As we were leaving Zorg's palace, we encountered a prisoner that appeared a bit mad. It was the guard at one of the colossus' locations we rescued that was counting numbers. He gave some prophecies. And he's still giving prophecies, moving some numbered matchboxes… and counting numbers. Crazy guy. He removed his pants and ran off, causing a bit of a distraction. Great!
We went to the place Zorg said and found a room with what appeared to be an air vent. We used a torch and control flame to weld the grate. We used a rope to get down into Stone Ward.

We made too much noise in that room and two guards came. We closed the door and burned one of them alive. The other one surrendered and we interrogated him about Deep Ward. He said the keys for Deep Ward are down in Deep Ward, so we need to get in to be able to get keys.

Zidor killed the guard after we finished interrogating him. Poor thing.

As we were peeking outside, we saw Magrus walk down with a prisoner to find another cell. He said silence Spells have gone off in C block down in Deep Ward. Maybe a distraction?

We killed Magrus, captain of the guard. He had a black key card on him. We think Black is for the governor's office and admin area. Meh…
After that, we freed the prisoner Magrus locked and gave him a key and a sword. He went on to free his mates and they all left, probably to kill some guards. That will distract them.

We followed the path we thought would lead us to the air vent down. We hid in the solitary confinement units until the guards went pass and then we left to find the air vent. We used the weld-torch trick again and with our two last ropes.
As we tried the black key, we encountered failure. We're locked in this room now… But! Ratrop's resourcefulness always shines through. He noticed the big pipe, which was of similar size to the one Magrus tried to escape through. So we went in. The first exit we encountered was to the security room. We tried to sneakily get in, but Iron fell out of the pipe and the guard was alerted.
We fought and killed the guard, who was set on fire by Zidor (for a change).

He accidentally switched something off in the control panel. We switched off some things that we thought were anti magic fields and then the screaming started. We saw eldritch creatures from the cameras and guards getting eaten.
We moved on through the pipes and encountered a room with a machine that was powering something. We extracted the power source and the machine powered down. The screaming got even louder. I think we're doing something wrong.
We continued through the pipes and saw some guards fighting horrible creatures and continued to the cell blocks. There was a dwarf holding the door closed. He got spooked when he came out of the pipe, but didn't leave the door. When we asked about "the blonde one", he pointed to a cell.
We didn't find Prince Orgaev. We found Sheva Darkbrood instead. She said Prince Orgaev was in Wroat. He was killed by someone working for Control. She said they didn't kill her because Elora would know, so they took her to Dreadhold. Apparently the conspiracy was not to hide the prince, but to quiet any witnesses!

As soon as Elora knew, she dropped the spell and we left.

After escaping, she told us the story. Since Elora asked her to "keep an eye on the queen", she started noticing the queen behaving strangely. Sheva noticed the Prince seemed suspicious about his mother. They talked and formed a plan to acquire a scroll of true seeing to check if the queen has been replaced. And she had! The prince saw she was a changeling, was freaking out and someone named Koteth cast Power Word Kill on the Prince. Damn!
Sheva tried to escape, but they captured her and sent her to this prison. She heard some more of their plans. They said the needed to be careful, the Daughters would grow suspicious and it would be dangerous if Elora and her friends would become allies with them. They are trying to bring the plane of madness to Eberron. That's bad. That's very bad.
