We stopped by the tailor, Santzu, and got some new clothes.

I got a blindsale shiftweave the included the following outfits:
7: Goblin leathers (hard leather outfits int dark greens from goblins in Darguun)
10: Street clothes
1: Leather asher aviator suit, goggles and knee high boots
9: Sparkly showman's suit. Covered in purple
8: Like Conan, rough hides that hide very little

I asked to get a good one also:
Traveler's clothes with boots and a hooded cloak
Light brown trousers with leather boots along with a white buttoned shirt and a blue jacket with white cuffs and golden buttons (kind of like a captain's jacket)
Black tabard with white edges and boots
Full military uniform. Dark red cloak over a black shirt with strapped pants and shoes (like this: https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/living-eberron-wayfinder-files/images/0/08/396E6F82-D611-4FFA-9BF3-BEB50D89EA9B.jpeg/revision/latest?cb=20181022153733)
Comfortable pyjamas

The Sivis director wanted to talk to us. Doyen is a famous bard that is running the house.

The lawyers were completely useless, we dismissed them immediately. We're taking the case ourselves.

Our arguments:

- RIP's opening statement
- Receipts from house Ghallanda when Jorasco took the refugees
- Mr. Copperkettle was feeding the refugees. "Can you describe the dining procedure?"
- One villager to describe her travel and the period of memory she forgot
- Calla d'Jorasco describing what they were doing with the refugees
- Calla d'Jorasco interview with Pan
- Feather fall packs proves House Deneth was there
- Pan's footage showing the destruction scene and Deneth presence
- Abel's friend to talk about Jorasco's bad character. Many wrongdoings in their history.


Letters to Lath Sharbul from the Laths that investigated the other three Jorasco sites:

> My Friend,
>
>The news you sent of Joraso's activities at Dakshin troubled me greatly. I rode with my sanrakshak to Uttar that same night. On arrival our mounts were spooked and would not enter the township. We proceeded on foot and were greeted by Jorasco house officers who bid us to keep clear as they were treating the refugees there for an outbreak of some disease. Regardless we demanded to see the refugees.
>
>One hundred and seventy three we counted there. Many in poor health and all confused. The most senior member there, Dr Norpos d'Jorasco, stated a sickness had swept the camp leaving his residents exhausted. The Jorasco staff seemed unaffected by this ailment and were treating them. On staff there was the doctor, two magewrights, a couple of guards and a warforged cook.
>
>We insisted on staying to help the guests of The Plains. No objection was made though I feel we were not overly welcome. Over the next couple of days we saw a marked improvement in the refugees. I spoke to several and they seemed to have lost their memory of the past three months. They remembered arriving there but nothing since
>
>As they were being cared for I felt it safer to leave them there but have left four of my sanrakshak to observe their continued good treatment. 
>
>I look forward to seeing you at Gatherhold in a few days.
>
>Yours,
>
>Jaranus

>Lath Sharbul,
>
>With haste we rode to Poorv as you bid us. We found one hundred and sixty cyrian refugees there. The Jorasco staff explained a sickness had swept the camp >following some spoiled food prepared by their cook. The refugees were not in good health and seemed exhausted, but Jorasco magewrights were caring for them.

>I warned that the building of these settlements went against our way. I do not care for this place and our mounts care even less. It is unnatural to build >permanent camps like this. It is of no surprise they are sick. I have left two men to observe their recovery and will return to Gatherhold for the 5th Lharvion as is demanded.

>Lath Barthus

>Lath Sharbul,
>
>What terrible news you bring from Dakshin. As you asked we rode immediately for Pashchim. We found no refugees there, only a handful of Jorasco staff. They were in the process of packing up what remained of their equipment after a fire that had started in their mess hall and swept across much of the camp. The clinic, overseers house were also fully destroyed. 
>
>We will set off for Gatherhold in the next few days. I have some excellent Valenair Tannat for you my friend.

>Brand
