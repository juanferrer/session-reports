Sword and Staffing agency, looking for work. Miss Ain. They have a Medini crest in the office. Mr. Toquill is our employer. We managed a contract of 3 gp/day (90 gp/month) 11 Hastehamtom Way, Platinate District, Middle Ward.
Mr. Toquill has been experimenting with mini-elementals and they and their offspring got loose in the lab. We need to trap the steam elemental with the provided tube. Morapar is the command word to activate the iron tube. After capturing it, Mr. Toquill shows us the reason for our hiring. We are to protect his house, especially the vaults, where he keeps many powerful and dangerous magical artefacts.
