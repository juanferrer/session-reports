After four days going through the tunnels, we prepared for the fight of our lives. Literally. I prepared some poison and RIP made us a heroes' feast!

We got:
- Immune to poison
- Immune to fear
- Adv on Wisdom
- +10 temp HP

I used the Zafu to scout the area. Here's what I found:
- Some drow to the south. Encampment?
- Spoiled soil. Excavations, probably.
- Middle ziggurat has been excavated.
- 3 level pyramid. Some hill giants. About a dozen drow. The witches are there, inside the middle section, which has a monolith in the centre. My sister is in one of the corners of the pyramid.
- The round building with the bronze top was empty. Nothing notable.
- Some drow near the henge. Stones look identical to henge.

We started going through the jungle towards the henge-like stones. As we approached the crystal patch we decided to go further into the jungle to avoid being seen. We encounter some sort of trench for giants. We lowered down into it and, while moving to the other side, we were attacked by a creature from under the mud. I almost killed it, so it ran away. We went to the other side and saw some of the drow near the henge.
Here are the powers we got:
- Order: Cannot lie, divination spells are cast 1 level higher
- Dal Quor: Empty
- Dead: If drop to 0, go to 1 HP
- Fire: Fire resistance
- Dawn: Maxed healing
- Chaos: Lightning resistance
- Twilight: Elemental spells 1 level higher
- Endless Night: +2 AC
- Ice: Cold resistance
- Battle grounds: +2d10 temp HP
- Sky: Flying speed of 30
- Fairie: Conjure Woodland Beings (no pixies)
- Madness: Temporary madness

We now march towards the ziggurat. We have the stuff they're expecting, so we don't think they will kill us.
