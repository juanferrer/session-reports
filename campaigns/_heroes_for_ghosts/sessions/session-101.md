After killing Xos, we saw everyone else disappear. Seraphine informed us that everyone is returned to their rooms after dying here. We looked around and Elora found a book (The Eldritch Anatomy: Unveiling the Symphony of Medical Sorcery). It was written by Xos. He describes the ritual *"that unfurls the tendrils of understanding"*. The entrails of a human, an elf and and a dwarf need to be arranged in a spiral pattern. That's dark…
Then we recite this words:

> *Vor'thexis en'shadow, ixul mor'tuus,*
>
> *Xul'karoth, throsk'athar, enshaduun zythrak*
>
> *Zur'tharok, k'yloth enshath*
>
> *Glo'ryth ix'urath, ve'kron zy'lothar*

I don't know where we're going to get volunteers for this…

We went on to the men's ward, hopefully we can find Cedric. We need to check he's alive. And if not, revive him. We found him, but only Elora was able to speak with him. He had her look into a mirror he had. She saw us back in Metrol, blowing up one of the palaces. We were hiding, waiting for an explosion that never came. RIP offered to check what had happened, and as he was about to touch it, it went off, killing him on the spot.
He spoke about changing reality with the mirrors. He spoke about the masters, who were able to change realities. Particularly he mentioned Jedra.
Then she tried. She thought back to that time where Fred, the donkey, died under the weight of the cart as we were transporting the C-PAD. But he never died. He always survives. We're always joking about how Frederick is always in the heat of battle but seems to always come out unharmed. He has two saddlebags of holding to carry all of our things.
She checked with us, and we were a bit confused. Abel suggested we imagine a reality where the door to the Hall of Mirrors is unlocked. And it appears it was so.

After that, Cedric recited the following:

> *In the chamber of reflection, shadows cling,*
>
> *Seven mirrors stand, a chorus to sing.*
>
> *Each pane a portal, illusions entwined,*
>
> *To Jedra's dominion, the Master of Mind.*
>
>
> *Fragmented glass, a gateway obscured,*
>
> *As seven mirrors shatter, illusions assured.*
>
> *Through splintered panes, a corridor twirls,*
>
> *To Jedra's realm, where vails unfurl.*

After that, we went back to Eberron. Once in Xen'Drik, we set up a conference call with everyone (Control, the Daughters, Lysee d'Sivis, General Nordar, Shava Darkbrood and Ammeron Adredar). We explained the situation with the Dael'kyr and the help we needed. Everything has been arranged. Control will get us the runes for the teleportation circle in the palace in Wroat. From there we will get our ship to get to the Talenta Plains and take Ammeron to the Astral Sea. He will join forces with Sachem to release and fight one of the Dael'kyr imprisoned in the Grove. In the meantime, Nordar and the rest of the Darguun army will enter Karrnath (with passage from Zorlan d'Cannith). They will reach the place near where the Fey Spire was and release and fight Jedra. Hopefully we can deal with both of them back to back.
Ammeron said Hesanas dropped a cubic gate to get to the Grove with the cubic gate.

Once in Wroat we contacted Ellie and she complained about us taking too long, that she's terribly bored and so on. I don't understand how, since she's in the capital of the world. She could do anything! But she's bothered she can't commit any major crimes… So she's been day-drinking for three weeks… I got her a self-help book on recovering from addiction. Wrapped it in gift paper and put her on her pillow. Unsigned.

We finally arrived in the Talenta plains. My hair is growing back the right colour. Thank heavens! Meriele didn't like it, but she tried to accept it. We were both relieved when RIP cast greater restoration on me.

After a day of sightseeing, we all had dinner together and shared stories. The next morning, we sent Ammeron through the portal to meet Sachem. A few days later, we received a sending from Sachem telling us they were setting off to the Grove.

We waited for several days and received updates from Ammeron and Sachem every so often. One of them mentioned the Githzerai had lost contact with the ship carrying Xakin. We've been

Finally, we received the message, "Riman is down, I repeat, Riman is down!". We spent the night, RIP prepared a heroes' dinner and we departed the next day. Back into the Asylum. We almost know everyone there now. We even got the name of the librarian beholder. He's Xanathar. The Xanathar. We even got signed copies of his Xanathar's Guide to Everything. I can't wait to read his work.

In the kitchen, we encountered a scene of horror… for a cow. Buttercup was in pieces on the table. We had to stitch it back together, but we were unable to complete the task. Buttercup rose from the butcher's table and we had to fight this ungodly creature.
