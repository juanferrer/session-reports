We have a full moon tonight (24th of Dravago 997YK).

Location of CPADs:

- One test detonation
- One destroyed by Ammeron Adredar
- One in Fort Zarlor with Jotra Munggen (missing)
- One lost in a shipwreck at Glamer Bay (missing)
- One lost in transit to the Cyrean front lines (missing)
- One with Valpos Humple (missing)

Bounty to find out about lightning rail status in Cyre.
Also, There’s a reward for “Doc” Ethen Karch in Sterngate. We got to Sterngate and asked around about “Doc”. He seems to be attacking people in the stagecoach to Groshk. We stayed at the Drunken Duck (sounds like the Excited Duck, it’s not a quest to find a Duck inn in every city we get to).

We got to Groshk and found a ping of the CPAD on the Chief Grish’s house (male bugbear). We still found the jail and decided to ask about the prisoners that were members of “Doc’s” band. Right before we went in, we saw two agents taking a goblin that was freaking out into the police station. He was “gnawing on a cow”, so he seems to have gone feral. He’s Clum, the baker, but some other citizens seem to have had the same symptoms.

Apparently Chief Grish is not a nice person. He seems to be disliked and maybe, if we can prove he’s doing some dodgy business, we can report it to the Captain and she can deal with him.

We entered the sewers and, after fighting some type of ooze, we got into the fort. After searching for a bit, we found General Nordar. She was looking for a weapon also. An ancient weapon, millenia old. The Ziggurat.
