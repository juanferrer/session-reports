Apparently the assassins are part of a house that, in public, acts as entertainers and actors, but in secret they have the best trained spies in Korvaire. They had a modified molar that, when pressed from a certain angle, released a green liquid. We think that’s the poison the last one of them used to kill himself.

[got disconnected here, not sure what happened]

Finally we reached the edge of the Mourning. Elora got on the Broom and reached the control tower in the middle. In the room south there were some stairs leading down. As she went down, she found a rock monster. There was a scroll on a box that read “Use in case of emergency”. It was a Planar Binding scroll. Able used it to put the rock elemental back into a crystal that she found on the floor. After trying a bit, we managed to get the bridge working as we needed.

The leader of house Canith and Lysee d’Sivis were there, along with other people that wanted to talk to us.
D’Sivis said that the epidiascope is a draconic invention, from Argonessen. She read some of the prophecies. She was shocked when she read the one that talked about her. These are extracts from the draconic prophecy. Lysee also said that RIPs mark may belong to the house of Death. It was wiped years ago, so we don’t know.

Control told us the king sends his regards. Officially, she said that Breland wants the queen. Unofficially, she thinks the queen shouldn’t leave the Mournland. It will start another war (as mentioned in the prophecy).
The lar (halfling) said they don’t want the queen in the Plains.
Then we met with the colonel from Karnath, who said they want the queen. He also said Breland sent assassins. He’s also being super racist. Don’t like him.
Lastly, we spoke to the head of house Cannith, Zolan d’Cannith, with his lawyers. He wanted to inspect the broom, get the plan and start producing more to sell. He wanted to continue producing them.

We went to talk to the queen’s guard. They weren’t happy with the options.
- Breland
- Karnath
- Stay in the Mournland
- Go with the Reforged

Control wanted to talk to us again. She offered to make a duplicate statue of the queen and drop the original in the ocean.
In the end, they left bound for Breland.
