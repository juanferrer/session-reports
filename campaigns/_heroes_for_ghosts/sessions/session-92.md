During combat, one of the guards came to check on Control and another guard happened to walk past her window. The second one saw us… Four telly stars killing the Head of Brelish Intelligence… It's going to be difficult to wiggle out of this one…

More guards got in through the door, but I kind of managed to convince them that wasn't Control. She blew her cover by speaking in tongues. Then Abel used Time Stop to destroy an hourglass Control had turned (we're not sure why just yet) and crushed her with her desk.

RIP lost the plot and still attacked the guards, who had not yet attacked us. Ah, RIP…
Anyways, Abel used mass suggestion to have them drink until they black out. One of the guards wasn't convinced, but he also left, not wanting to die there.

We got some things from Control's desk: A purple everbright lantern, a letter and Vaster's hourglass. We picked up her body

We changed back into the guard's clothes and walked out the way we came. When we were out, we saw a ball of fire in the sky. Getting larger and larger. Like a meteor?! The site of impact was like 1000 feet from where we were. We pushed against the people rushing out.
The colossus that Quillion stole… We have to destroy it. Even if it risks our mission.

I used my armour's blink to get inside the head and saw the brain had been enhanced with Xoriat's tech, with tentacles coming out of the casing and stuff. Elora appeared with RIP shortly after. Elora pushed some buttons and accidentally set off some attacks that destroyed a building.

We managed to break the casing and RIP absorbed the brain. We still look like some random guards, by the way. Went to have dinner and discuss what to do next.

When asked, Toquill said we could get to Xoriat by finding a portal on the moon (Lharvion). We need to get to the Astral Sea anyways, so we probably can do two-for-one.
So, plan:


- Kill Elora's mum impersonator
- Meet with BB
- Travel to Lharvion
- Attune to Xoriat (and travel there)
- Kill Vaster
- Return Control's corpse to the Daughters (should start calling her Emily, to be honest)

When we arrived at Elora's mum's house (manor!), we were received by the butler (which Elora noted was a changeling) and he guided us to the sitting room. In the desk, Abel found a letter written by Salmon to her sister. Since the other sister left alive is Coteh, we can assume the impersonator is her. We have history, so it will be good to finally put her down.
