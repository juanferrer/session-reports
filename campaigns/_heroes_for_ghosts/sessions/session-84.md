The battle started. We were on a side island, so we moved over to the bigger one, where we guessed the other team would be. They were hidden in the bushes. One came out and attacked us. The other one let free a bunch of logs at us! The PM went to him and only gave him a strong word. WHAT?! HE COULD HAVE KILLED SOMEONE! They got the PM in their pocket. Cheaters… Anyways, RIP and I still managed to kill the two of them. Abel and Elora killed one of the other two and caught up to Frapplestamp, which was cheatingly looking for the skull. Anyways, he found it, Abel and Elora got in his face and a ghost appeared, grabbed Frapplestamp by the neck and pulled his face off. This is the description I got from Abel, so I didn't see it with my own eyes, but I did see the faceless corpse of the gnome and the discarded face nearby, so it sounds pretty accurate.

They apparently got the actual skull of Elwell Payne. What a coincidence… In the end RIP used Severance to consume the essence of the skull. He also revived Frapplestamp, but he was horribly disfigured. Don't think he'll be glad to be alive…

After a night of celebration we went back to the ship and started planning how (and what) we were going to do with the Dreadhold. We're not sure it's the greatest of ideas to break out the prisoner anymore…


Stuff Apex knows about the Dreadhold.
On top of each tower there is a heavy siege wand. Incredibly powerful.
Workshops and Laundry are operated by good behaved prisoners. Also the kitchens, on the other tower.
- Red Ward: Normal prisoner population. 60 ft below ground level. Go down in an elevator and go down to that level. A second elevator leads to the next floor down. You need to get in a cage and be let out by one of the guards.
- Gold Ward: High welfare. Celebrities and politicians. What? They even have servants.
- Stone Ward: Max Security. RIP's character was there. Permanent silence on every cell. Constrained in a straight jacket.

There are rumours of other areas of the prison. Even a Vault, but no prisoner has been to it.
There is a stable of manticores and manticore riders for aerial defence.

Krek appeared. He was a highwayman, targeting dwarves for some reason.

Zaydor, pyromaniac, responsible for horrible murders, including people being burnt alive. Extremely dangerous.

Apex, human ranged, attempted regicide of king Boronel.
