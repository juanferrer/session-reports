This blonde guy, long fingers and completely white eyes just showed up and stopped the Tikka. I couldn't hear much of what he said, but he took Elora and told us to meet her at the top of his "fun tower". We will fight the Tikka afterwards.

We stepped through the door and found ourselves in this small room with a metallic arm holding a blue gem. There were pictograms carved into the sides of the pillar. There were a few lamps that had a hand sign under them. After like 20 minutes of trying different things, we touched 4 hands and the door opened. Huh…

We found three statues around a brazier. They appeared ready for battle.
- ?: Snout and horns. Gold gem in left hand, spike flail in right hand
- Bull: Single eye, mouth open. Red ruby in left hand and sword in right hand
- Three eyes, single horn: Empty left hand, trident in right hand.

We pulled an Indiana Jones and swapped a piece of glass from a window we smashed before with the blue gem. Then placed the gem on the hand of the three-eyed statue. It seemed to activate a portal, but not fully. We moved the weapons around so that the horns matched the pointiness of the weapon. And then the portal opened. Yay!

The portal led us into a lava lake. Felt like the plane of fire. Awfully hot. There was a word on the floor. TNEMHSIRUON was written on the floor. A horse of fire appeared and came running to us, but was stopped by an invisible barrier. Abel screamed "Nourishment", and RIP cast Create Food and Water. We started throwing food through the barrier while the horse was eating it. The lava started cooling unnaturally quickly. Trees started springing up and the horse transformed into a unicorn. Then a portal appeared and we went through.

We arrived at an icy cave. We were in an elevated area and saw some pillars with pipes coming out of them. There was an ice cube in the centre of the cave. RIP found a button and after pressing it, another cube appeared in the middle of the room, causing the cube at the centre to slide away.

We spent a long time shuffling cubes around and finally discovered that one of them had a key inside it, which we needed to activate the portal. I started trying to break the key out, but a gelatinous cube appeared when the ice broke. We killed it and the one inside the other cube and then used them for the portal.

A room appeared, wooden walls, paintings, some flags, two armours, several tables and fewer doors. There were, interestingly, 7 tables, 6 doors, 5 paintings, 4 flags, 3 of us, 2 armours and 1 entryway. Abel tried opening one of the doors and it connected to the one we came in through, so she saw her back. Strange.

The paintings had 7 people, 7 flowers, 7 boats, 7 cows and 7 houses, all in different paintings. The 7 tables had a descending number of goblets on top of them. RIP moved the goblets so that there were 7 goblets in each table. And then, when opening the door, it led to a purple room.

In the purple room. There were some mushrooms, some rocks and a door at the back of the room. Near us there was a table with a key in it.There are several scorch marks on the floor. Abel tried to pick up the key and then a beholder showed up! There's only three of us this time…

The thing paralyzed Abel and frightened and slowed me. It was all up to RIP, so he used sunbeam and des-troyed it. The beholder was trying to hide from him near the end, poor thing.

Anyways, Abel ran to the door, opened it and called us over to the door.

We appeared in a tavern. It was lovely, warm fire, food on the table. We took some time to investigate and found nothing to do. Abel suggested going to sleep was the solution, so we tried that. After half an hour we checked on her again and she wasn't there. We decided to go to sleep, hopefully following her.

And we finally got to Elora. She was in a cage and the Tikka was in another one. 7 candles were arranged in front of Elora's cage and 4 exposed flames around the Tikka's cage. We used the different colours of the lights to light the candles, which opened both cages. Fight!
