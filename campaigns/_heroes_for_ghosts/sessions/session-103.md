One of the first things that happened was Abel using feeblemind on Jedra. He ate it and was drooling for the rest of the fight. Also, Bedra came back from the maze, he wasn't happy.

I killed a guy by sitting on him. It was… an experience. I weighed about 600 kg, so that killed him outright.

We killed Jedra… but Bedra became Jedra. Oh, no… He's come back in full strength and killed Elora.

Elora was in and out to the Astral Sea a couple of rounds, no one was sure what was going on there.

RIP banished Jedra while we finished the minions. We got ready and when RIP dropped the spell, a gold dragon was before us. Abel used a clutch Dispel Magic (level 3) that countered the True Polymorph (level 9).
