We did our usual stuff and travelled to Xoriat. We searched for Elana, as she was ready now to help us face Xakin. She gave Elora a clay doll depicting Xakin with two female figures. As she tried to communicate with the statuette, she felt compelled to go to the treatment room (great, just where we wanted to go). As she passed the staff room, the elder brain poked itsâ€¦ brain?... out the door and looked at Elora passing by. A fight nearly started, but Elora managed to convince everyone that we were going to get treatment. Even after RIP and BIP hit one of the orderlies with two Toll the Dead.

Once in treatment, Elora convinced the elder brain to demonstrate the procedure on the Xakin doll. And it worked again!

We reached Xakin's realm. Very confusing place. We saw a lot of cell doors and swirling patterns of colour on the floor, kind of like an oil leak. In front of us there was a spiralling hall that led to a colourful void, with floating stones and Xakin in the distance. He called himself the Harbinger of Salvation and said we were in our consciousness. This creature was calling for our worst fears. To my mind came the image of myself, old and frail, dying alone in bed. No one cared about me and I cared about no one.

We jumped into the fight straight away. A void monster appeared and then some other thing that I didn't get to see, as RIP banished it immediately.
The fight was tough, but we managed to get him. Belora turned into a brass dragon, which is not her permanent form.

We visited Abel's brother in the Astral Sea and then travelled to Talenta Plains, where we met with Elora's family. They had the strangest family dynamic I've ever seen.
