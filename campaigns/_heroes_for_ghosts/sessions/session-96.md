We shopped, had a hero's feast and got ready to plane shift into Xoriat. We arrived to an nice looking building.

- East: Within me, the past's ink is preserved, secrets and stories, carefully conserved. Unlock my secrets, if you hold the key, to enter the realm of authority. (Warden)
- North: I'm a surgeon of minds, in this twisted domain, Where illusions and shadows drive people insane. With tentacles probing and secrets concealed, In the depths of your thoughts, your truths are revealed. In the canvas of dreams where reality's frayed, I create new perceptions with skills so depraved. But complete it is not and so none may pass. Until my likeness resides above brass What is it you seek, in this dark, swirling sphere, to bring clarity to chaos, and make everything clear? In this riddle I've posed, you'll find the right cue, to open the door what must you do? (Medical)
- West:Waiting room
- South: Waiting room

Abel was considering the different options for the east door, and when she mentioned Book, the door unlocked and we opened it. Inside it looked like a luxurious office and a desk, with a large, tentacle brain with a top hat sitting on it. Across the desk, there was a nurse, her face was all wrong, very disturbing. He went on giving us the pitch for the asylum, receiving us as guests. He was very convincing. After inviting us to the waiting room, we all went there and sat, to wait our turn.
A woman was there too. She was holding a doll and was looking into infinity.
After a while, she started speaking about being wound down
Abel offered to be wound up, and she accepted. When she was done, she started speaking. "Seek the man of numbers, the puppet master, the weeping one, the whisperer, the collector, the one who looks up, the seeker. Each holds a piece of the asylum's truth. The oldest childâ€¦ he holds the key". Her name was Evelina.
While she was saying these things, another nurse came and took Evelina and said she would come for us later.

We were going crazy, so Abel burned us with her cigarette, and we snapped out of the mass suggestion. We looked around and were unable to figure out how to open any of the doors, so we went back to the west door, the medical room. We figured out that we needed to "create a new perception of his likeness", on the unfinished painting.
Inside the room there was a woman sitting on a bench and the corpse of an orderly on the floor. We inspected the body and noticed it was similar to a creature we encountered on the Mournland.
The woman was talking about a theory and that it worked. She said "our thoughts shape the fabric of this place". Lucienne was her name. She mentioned there are other secrets. Interesting.

Checking a nearby desk, Abel found a patient list. She found both Himo (Elora's dad) and Control (whose name was crossed out).

We checked the storage rooms and as we came out, we saw dark tendrils coming out of the chair Lucienne was sitting at, and she was absorbed into the chair. Very creeped out, we left.

Out of frustration, we went into the women's wing and encountered a singing lady. Singing, she guided us to the male wing. We went up a set of spiral stairs, which turned out to be going down when we reached the end. And we were in the west wing! That was easy.

The first person we spoke to was an undead playing with toys. The oldest child! He had arranged his cubes into 10 stacks of 5. It turned out to be the key for the cubic gate that opens a portal to Xoriat.

We found the puppet master. He said he was the director and could control everyone. When we asked him about the ending of the script, he recognised us as the protagonists. He shared the seventh unveiling with us.

Unveilings:

- 1st: ? Connected to the Kitchens
- 2nd: Revealed by Felix, the Mathematician (Man of Numbers). A library of forbidden knowledge. If we enter the library against the librarian's wishes, we need to form a magic circle. Delve into the arcane texts to find the necessary instructions and the law to arrange the symbols.
- 3rd: ?
- 4th: ?
- 5th: ?
- 6th: ?
- 7th. Revealed by the puppet master. In the heart of the asylum, there is the machine. There, we will witness the seventh unveiling. We will need to use the machine to alter reality and have brought about what we wish this place to be. We must complete the other six unveilings before attempting the seventh.

We continued speaking with several different inmates/patients, most of them crazy, but some of them gave us clues about the unveilings.
Finally, we found Elora's dad.

After him we encountered the book keeper (Ozymandias?). Sorting his books we managed to unlock the library. Vaster is now unlocked (right and second left from the male wing's north door).
