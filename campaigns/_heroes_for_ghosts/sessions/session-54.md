After going a bit deeper into the place, we found two more giants and an in-progress colossus. We killed them and asked the corpse of the big boss a few questions.
- They want to bring destruction down on the day walkers.
- The mightiest giant ordered the project.
- Severance is a tool needed to finish the in-progress colossus.

We spend a short rest deciding whether we should destroy or try to awaken the colossus. As we tried, an imp-like creature climbed out of a hatch that materialised on the floor, delivered a message and left. It was an invitation with a code (probably from Hasanas)

"Exquisit Regulation" were the keywords for the Daanvi face of the cubic gate. 

Where there is truth and law, it follows perfect order. We arranged everything and travelled there. Turns out, Hasanas needs help from Elora to win a bet about the best musician in the planes.

Zariel, the she-devil, is the biggest wig in the event. She’s very powerful. Also, she sounds hot.
Here’s the plan:
- Abel is the stylist
- RIP is the voice trainer
- Adrik carries the bags
- Varhoe and Brilan are the bodyguards (with suits and sunglasses)
- And Elora is the artist

Sivis does political espionage. King Koth is involved in the emerald claw, but there’s rumours he’s a vampire.
