Just as we were about to rest for the day, we saw some lights and heard humanoid voices. It was a farm. We decided not to interact with it. However, as soon as we started preparing for the night, some creepy ghosts appeared and started attacking us. We decided to run towards the house.
After fighting off the ghostly creatures, we went into the house but it was empty.
We found two corpses in a house. Elora cast Speak with Dead. They said they saw a light and heard a noise coming from the west. Then a fog came. 

As we got to Metrol, we went south trying to the Palace of Storms, but we encountered some people stopping us. Apparently they’re part of the Cyrean military and they’re protecting the Overseer and the Queen. They said we should deal with the Warforged problem and we could go through.

As we left, a warforged saw us around RIP and started running. After catching him, we managed to talk for a bit. The "Death to all fleshies" seems to be a fake claim, the leader of the warforged, "22", apparently never said that. However, they tend to refer to non-warforged as "fleshies".

The things we fought were the ghosts of the previous inhabitants of Cyre.

"The Unbound One", Sachem, seems to be calling the warforged. They are congregating in the Mournland. The Watchers are also residents of the Mournland, but they are against the warforged.

There is a ring in the centre of Cyre that isn’t covered in fog.

[I disconnected here…]

The "reforged" want to build a civilisation here. They want us to kill the watchers, but maybe we can find a way to help them find peace somehow. They’re looking for Kaiba dragonshards. There are some in the Palace of Winds.
