After fighting the squid and the little squids, we took a short rest and went to fight the basilisk. After it almost turned Elora to stone, we killed it. While we were removing the stomach (and RIP getting the eyes), Medusa appeared, asking why we killed her pet. Elora cast Tasha's Hideous Laughter on her and we escaped.
We started making a bridge to cross the gap and something was coming, so we jumped in the pool where the squids were and swimmed through the tunnel RIP saw earlier. As I predicted, it led us to the waterfall we saw before the path.

Instructions for basilisk juices: 

We decided to go back into the cave.
