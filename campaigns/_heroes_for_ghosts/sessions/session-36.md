Are we keeping the telescope? Too big.

After a long rest back at the station, RIP turned into a T-Rex and, with the party on his back, run to the Palace of Earth.

We started looking for the documents required (some land permits from Karnath) and were attacked by them. We fought them off, but found nothing in the room. As we went into the hallway, we found a ball of energy that seemed to have a field of silence around it. We managed to bypass it. On the next two rooms we found monsters. The first one had a vault, which is kind of what we’re looking for, but we decided to wait and continue walking. We did fight the monsters in the next room, one of which reduced Elora’s INT to 5!!! She didn’t change much, though. After that, we arrived at a bigger room with a vortex in the middle. After fighting it, other 5 creatures appeared, which we also fought off very easily, thanks to RIP’s Turn Undead. We noticed a room under the one we were in, and as we lowered down to it, we were surrounded by 6 weeping angels. They quickly started attacking when we blinked, turning Elora and RIP into stone. Not sure what we’ll do.
