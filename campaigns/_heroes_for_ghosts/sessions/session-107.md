Quillion used chain lightning onto his own minions to be able to reach us. Both Elora and I were hit. Immediately after, he used Power Word Kill on Elora. She was dead. Enraged, I attacked him, dealing the killing blow. As he died, he said we "set the stage of our own demise". Did we really? Unable to meet its creator, the aberration in the centre collapsed in on itself, before ever experiencing life. Never thought I'd be happy about a stillbornâ€¦ I guess there's always a first time. There's only Vral'a'yak left. And a few ghosts.

RIP started praying to his gods asking for them to spare Elora. And they did! Elora was resurrected and was able to continue fighting.
Abel cast Maze on Vral'a'yak, hopefully that gives us some time to regroup and prepare for when she comes back. Abel ended up killing her with disintegrate. The Daughters will never be able to complete her Dael'kyr head collection.

After the deed, we spoke with the librarian. He explained that the Dael'kyr had already completed the first six unveilings and if we were to perform the seventh unveiling now, it would effect all the changes they had prepared.

What they had prepared:

- 1st: Slaughterhouse - Life and Death (Erase dragons)
- 2nd: Library - Change in technology (Bestow some sort of dragonmark on warforged)
- 3rd: Nature of the Divine (Ascend the Daughters into a triumvirate gods of Chaos)
- 4rd: Medicine, healing or their anthitesis (Enact a magical plague to corrupt all of Eberron)
- 5th: Change in Magic (Wild magic throughout all of Eberron)
- 6th: Evolution of Species (Replace all humanoid species with other humanoid species).

What we will do:

- 1st: Restoring life to Cyre
- 2nd: Some form of travel between the Astral Sea and Eberron
- 3rd: null
- 4th: Restore Zoriat to a place of healing and tranquillity
- 5th: Restore Cyre back to normal (no funky magic)
- 6th: Provide a way for Warforged to reproduce

We went through all the unveilings and prepared the ritual as described above. When the ritual was completed, Xanathar disappeared, but nothing else seemed to have changed. When we stepped out of the portal, we found ourselves in a garden. We saw Lucien and one of the other patients. They seemed happy now. But they were not patients! It was the House of Thought.

Abel had an exchange with one of them, who was sculpting a statuette. It represented the eternal balance between evil and good. Abel wanted to keep it, even unfinished, which they considered a statement in itself.

In the library we found Cedric (alive!) and Xanathar, which looked much better. We returned the books of the unveilings. He was horrified by their contents and we suggested they be kept under lock and not lent out.

In the chapel we encountered Seraphine (Elora's fangirl) and Lillian (the Mourner). They didn't remember us, but Seraphine looked interested in Elora.

We spoke briefly with the "Director", which was more like a General Counselor. He described the location as a place of consideration and repose. Looks very peaceful.

Anyways, we planeshifted back to Xen'Drik and found all the guards there and everything. Lycee also remembered how everything was. But the Mournland was cured. Kind of. It was still in ruins, but the fog was gone. Life had returned. The ruins have been reclaimed by nature. But it was OK!

We watched the sunset from the roof of one of the towers.

The next morning, as we went down for breakfast, Abel did not join us. As I went to look for her, I found her lying in her bed. She was dressed in her favourite blue dress, the one she has worn so many times before. In her hands I found envelopes with each of our names. I took a moment to remember the years we had spent adventuring together and wished her luck on the next part of her journey. I took the envelopes and went downstairs to share the news with everyone.

In the envelopes there were invitations to her wake. This was the text:

> IN LOVING MEMORY....
>
> Abelwiss Alysse Adredar
>
> You are cordyally invited to a gathering to celebrate the life of the legend and hero Abel, who was not only awesome but also saved the entire universe probably. She will be dearly missed.
>
> The wayk will take place this evening at the Hellcienda on Daanvi (travel papers enclosed). Refreshments and tishues will be provided.
>
> P.S. You can have my stuff.

So, she's with Hassanas. We can probably keep visiting her. We will have to speak with her tonight.
