There's my family's store! Caebrek & Daughter: Expedition Specialists. We stayed at One Good Tern, a good inn (not top notch, but not bad either), run by Ozzy. Also, Adrik thinks mermaids have human legs and the top part of a fish. And apparently they're delicious.
Apparently no one has been in Caebrek & Daughter for a long time (at least a couple of months), although there were some fresh footprints. We asked in the store next door
Wylkeses owns the building, apparently they left without notice and stopped paying rent. Brommar is still around, though. He's working for the Wylkeses.

Magrus Caebrek died a few months ago (three months ago). We were led to his grave. Also, fresh flowers, a few days old. There are also some runes, but they're not dwarven. He's also 360 years old. But the birth date is wrong? His birthday was on the 5th of Lharvion. He always insisted in celebrating his birthday on the 12th, but the date is off by 6 months at least.

Abel translated the meaning of the words into common: "Pnxz ofqxupgb wjwp armwf gx cpkbi vvram xjdyj"
Maybe code, maybe gibberish. Giant is the language.Using codes has been used by giants before.
Parents were on an expedition when Magrus died.
Lassites and Jonas Wylkeses have been asking about the Caebrek. Brommar owes 4k gold!
We went to speak to the Wylkeses. We have been invited for dinner at 7pm.

Tishnar ordered 5 indigo allusions once a week for 2 years. They are known particularly for their colour. The order started for the 10th of Nymm.

Broche of Turtle: Easier to get up (+5 ft. movement)
