Abel’s message was delivered to her brother in the Astral Sea. I also sent 625 gp to Meriele to help the refugees. “We found this in the vaults in Cyre. I hope it helps the citizens”.
We met a captain that can take us closer to the pyramid in the jungle. 500 + 300 gp for everything and 5gp/day for Varhoe.
We also got tipsy in the tavern celebrating.

Pan belongs to the Lhazaar Regalport Pirate Association, a Roleplay Game group. They LARP a lot. We signed up so maybe we RP a RP! So meta…
Abel spoke to the mephits in the engine. They’re slaves! Conscious and with a concept of family and home. We’re probably joining the “Free the Elementals” movement.

We got attacked by some merfolk. He said we would pay for “consuming the flesh of their people”. Is this because we ate the mermaid? O.O
We killed most of them, but two escaped.
