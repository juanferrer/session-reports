The Prince was shocked that the Daughters attacked them. The Daughters are strong arch-fey.
We decided to kill Mahari and have RIP harvest her soul with Severance. After that we're going to the plane of fire.

Elora was unable to use detect thoughts on her.

We were about to start the execution of Mahari and Sora Katra called. She said the Sisters have gone rogue and they no longer work for the Daughters. She offered to take Mahari off our hands to deal with the problem. We said we would kill her on camera. Damn, we're doing snuff on request nowâ€¦

The Daughters suggested we need to go to the plane of madness to defeat Quilion. He can be banished anywhere, but can only be destroyed there.

We got to Flamekeep and saw the news:
- Karrnath forces continue to build on the border with the Talenta Plains. Reports of skirmishes over the border, safely driven back by the tribes. Karrnath claims the Talenta Plains are Karrnathi territory.
- Breland declares a month of mourning for the death of the prince of Cyre in honour of Queen Darnel. King Boranel's health continues to deteriorate. The parliament calls for a vote for Breland to become a republic.

We went to the Cathedral of the Flame to see if we could come to their teleportation circle. We were speaking with one of the priests and he said he would find out for us. In the meantime, Jalah Darren, the keeper of the Flame, showed up and after a brief conversation with us, took us to the circle.

We purchased some stuff and got ready to visit the plane of fire.

After a good night's sleep, we used plane shift to get to the City of Brass. Immediately we knocked over the drink of some fire dwarves. We gave them another drink and shared some stories.

We saw giff, scaly humanoids, and all other kinds of creatures.

As we discussed with the dwarves, he mentioned something about the elemental problem. "They're causing more problems than usual". The floaty guys might have more information.

We approached them and he confirmed they've been having issues with them lately. He was the captain of the Matsara, Sirin Zey.. They believe it's coming from an industrial site outside of the city, in a place called Fen'iks Tashkil. Belongs to a powerful efreeti. He's working with humans. He's also been selling armour made of a new material (Fernyxium). They've not let the authorities in and the law's hands are tied. He said it would be helpful if some outsiders got in and stopped whatever is going on in there.
He also gave us some documents to say we are permitted to be there for trading and commerce.

We left and went ahead to the factory.

The plan is to come up with a sales pitch. Something like "we're planning to buy a lot of your armour and sell it elsewhere", "establish trade routes", etc. Hopefully they invite us in. Or maybe pose as investors.
