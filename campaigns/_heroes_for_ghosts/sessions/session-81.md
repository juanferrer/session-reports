After killing Kifu we decided to let everyone know they should leave. We stopped by the office and had to pick the lock to get the door open. There was no one in, but we found a ledger showing that they were not reporting the profit they were making. Tax evaders. They're the worst… I don't even feel bad for killing him.

We continued our way out and found the guards. We tried to tell them the boss was dead and they should just leave, but they did not listen. We had to kill a few ones, but the last one paid attention and instructed everyone else to leave. We all managed to get something interesting from the warehouse. Here's the story for mine:

> "The Periapt of Wound Closure is a powerful item forged by Olladra, goddess of medicine, in ancient times. It was said that whoever possessed the band would never have to worry about wounds, as they would instantly close and heal upon contact with the wearer's skin. The band was gifted to a great warrior who had been tasked with defeating a monstruous army that threatened the land.The warrior, Pharom Aralar, who had been tasked with defeating the monstruous hordes seeping through the Demon Wastes. Pharom was able to fight for days on end without rest, his wounds closing as soon as they were inflicted. He ultimately emerged victorious as the monsters receded. The Periapt of Wound Closure was passed down through generations of warriors, becoming a symbol of hope and protection in times of war."

Anyways, we went to the slave dorms, RIP banished the golem there and we broke the doors to get the slaves out (we couldn't find the

The harpy, Dune, was bathing somewhere and then suddenly appeared in Fernia. She's not sure how she got captured.

The man, Gerhardt, was practising some magic from a magic book. Whatever spell he was casting must have gone wrong, as he ended up in the city of brass.

The Eladrin, Scarlet, was left behind after her spire stopped briefly in Fernia.

The Bugbear, Rinema, was visiting a volcano on the border between Breland and Darguun, fell asleep and woke up in Fernia.

They all were keen on going back to Eberron, so we used the Cubic Gate and appeared in Xen'Drik. The ex-slaves went with agents of house Sivis, hopefully they can return wherever they need to go.

We rested and had breakfast. Pan was fuming in front of the ScryPhone. Some Salmin Fapplestamp, Pan's first LARP mate, started a mutiny and took his crew. I think we're going to the Pirate Fest to vote for the Pirate King. Pan explained to us how to create characters for the LARP game. The game was invented by Barry Lydax, during the middle of the last war. They were playing this in the trenches for a bit of escapism.

We travelled to Flame Keep, exchanged the 9k diamonds and gave 1000gp to Pan. We mostly deposited the rest.

We purchased a few things for the Pirate Fest and went to Taer Syraen. But it wasn't there! They left? They didn't even say "thank you"… Elora spotted a rock, not sure how that's important. Some monoliths. There we found the portal that led to the pocket dimension that was holding the Daelkyr.

He spoke about Quillion and the Sisters. Apparently Quillion was influencing Kifu. We are not sure about this.

Anyways, we decided to drop Scarlet, the Eladrin, in her home plane directly. But that will only be possible after Pirate Fest, as it would take us longer than a week to go to the Demon Wastes (for the attunement) and get back.
