After putting the cow away, we had a short rest and suffered the consequences of madness.
We discussed our tactics and then jumped through the portal with Fred at the head, as usual.

We found ourselves in a room with a bunch of other humanoids, like sheep in the slaughterhouse. We got up on the platform where the overseer was commanding the livestock forward just as he left through a door, which was closed behind them. We found another exit next to a guy putting meathooks into the backs of the people. Through the archway we were able to see the full process. The bodies, hanging from the conveyor belt, went through different stations, being bled, deboned, scolded and skinned, all while they screamed their lungs out. Pretty disturbing stuff to be honest. Riman was in the middle of it, running the show.

We engaged immediately. The fight was tough. I created a storm sphere right under the suspended platform and jumped down towards Riman to fight him. Elora summoned a Bigby's hand and started punching.
At one point, a vortex of blood and entrails started pushing people away, which was disgusting. Elora died, but was revivified by RIP. But we were victorious.

We searched the place and found the following:
- Horrifying Haversack
- Riman's Cleaver
- Necromantic Revelation: The Unveiling of the Abyssal Resurgence

After that, we went back to Eberron. Something strange happened. Abel received a message from her brother:

> "Sis, mission at The Grove failed, Vral'a'yak escaped with Quillion's aid. Deeply sorry. We're all ok. Worried about your safety confronting Riman in Xoriat."

We also received messages from General Nordarr and a report back from the Astral Sea. TL;DR: Jedra was defeated with heavy losses. The Astral Ship with Xakin was defeated by the Githyanki.
