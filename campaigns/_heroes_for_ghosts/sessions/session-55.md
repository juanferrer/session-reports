"So horny" is Hasanas’ contact in the Hellcieda. They can give us some info.

The other band is staying in the room next to the stage. They’re called "Rage Against the Divine".

We’re expected to start at 8, the main event is at 10. Trugen is the name of the hostess.

Denroth doesn’t want to be disturbed. NE is where his quarters are. NW are private suites.

We went to Eye-Kea, got some stuff without paying (as they only accepted Brelish Express), so we got a fine.

Back in the Hellcienda, I’m trying to use the Zafu to find the instrument. I also want to check Denroth’s quarters, maybe I can spot something.

Mr. Denroth looks like Lumi, the guy who taught Elora how to be a Bard. Apparently he can control Elora. She can’t resist the commands he gives her.
Denroth keeps the instrument in his safe in his suite. There’s a magical lock on the safe. He keeps some more instruments. We could try using some of those.
We took a drug called Hazard, which negates the effect of Daanvi.
