We dragged Jonas’ unconscious body out of the house, where Ortor had called the Iron Guard. We healed him and, after some speaking, we understood he probably had been possessed by the obelisk and had no recollection of what had happened. We promised to help and investigate the next day.

We cracked the code. The engraving on Magrus’ grave, means the following:
DEEP MOUNTAIN MADE SOUTH OF WYRMS SPINE CRAGS

The Obelisk is something called a Dream Kanaiba. They’re very difficult to destroy. They reflect magic and physical damage.

Each of the sides of the Cubic Gate:
Eberron, Daani, Kythri, Lamannia, Xoriat and Astral.

We decided to ask the warforged to get the obelisk on a boat and drop it in the open sea.
As we were going to the Wylkes mansion to check everything was alright, someone approached me to sell some mermaid meat. I’m to meet him tonight near the docks.

As we went down to the cellar, we found the corpse of the butler, which, as RIP learned, had been there for a week. We spoke to him the night before, so something fishy is going on…
“Could you describe who killed you?” “He looked like me”
“How did he kill you?” “[Something] on the throat”
“Were you aware of the obelisk that was brought into the house?” Yes, he was
“Did the person that looked like you say anything to you?” “No”
“[Something]” “I served the master well”

In the library we found some info:
- Geologists believe the climate of the continent has changed in the past millennia, meaning it was less hostile at the time of the giants
- 5 different types of giants: 
 - Fire giants: Binders Atol
 - Frost giants: Everice
 - Storm giants: Under the South Thunder Sea and the lakes of the continents
 - Hill giants: Central jungle
 - Stone giants: Fangs of Argarak
- A book on lycanthropy: They have been driven to extinction in Khorvaire by the purge from the Silver Flame. There are some in Xen’Drik.
- Deep pits seem to be a good place to find Spheres of Annihilation

When Jonas sent out the invitation, the Omaren were going to have no one attend. He suggested they ask if Lacey specifically could attend. A bit strange. Were the butler and Lacey in it together? They’ve probably been replaced by changelings.

We finally purchased the mermaid meat and Elora got some bull’s eggs from a minotaur. We had them for breakfast. I don’t think Abel knew what it was.
