Objectives for today:
- Beat the other musician
- We want to steal the instrument
- Destroy some contracts? That would be a bonus

We got ready for the performance. Elora pulled out the guitar for the performance and blew everyone away. Lumi got taken away by the judge to discuss his lack of contracts and Hesanas was happy with us.

Then we travelled back to Stormreach, purchased some stuff and back to Indigo. Travelled a few days through the Khyber tunnels and arrived at Verdant, where we plan to sleep before the big fight.
