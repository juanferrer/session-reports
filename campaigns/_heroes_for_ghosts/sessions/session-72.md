So, we're in a tavern they made just next to the door of the cubic gate. Silaris is the name of the Githzerai prisoner we found.
Ameron was keeping the C-Pad. He was tasked to destroy a Cyrean weapon, a colossus. His team was caught during the assault and almost didn't make it out. Apparently they were expecting them. One of the team was an informant for Cyrean intelligence. They noticed one of the team had left. An elf.
While they were getting ready to try again, the Mourning happened.He woke up in a giff hospital.
A few months later they recovered, stole a ship and went after the traitor.They encountered the "squids", were losing and the githzerai (Silaris' people) rescued them. They confirmed they had the traitor and they were taking him to the rest of his group, back to the gifs. Then the githyanki attacked, they fought together and were captured by them. The traitor was Elora's father.

The githzerai have had the Five Gul (outsiders) prisoner for centuries. They can't kill them, as they return after their death. Himo was one of the people the githzerai rescued. They were taking him to the other refugees, but he was disobedient and started talking with the Gul. He attacked the ship's mind, killed it and they were left drifting in the astral sea. He then reached the githyanki and was turned into a mind, which is what we saw.

Ameron gave us a list of all 13 colossus and the targets. RIP sent the list to Toquill.
Elly also left us a note with the info of a teleportation circle. We need to figure out the missing runes.

Elora's letter to Meriele:

>We found dad in astral see, he servived the morning. However his mind has been corrupted. You may see him in our show, hes a fucking brain, yes a fucking brain. Can you believe this. I always told farther your to smart now you're a fucking brain. Im letting you know as you may see him on our show, yes a fucking brain. I don't know what to do, I will let mum know. But I donno if I can help him. We may have to put him to rest but Im conflicted , ye hes literally a brain. Wish this nether happened. But we can all be together again. No spying no war. Mum is looking after a fake queen. Everything is a mess. Guess how he survived. He was court by his mark. And they tried to blow him up with a cpad and ended up in the astral sea. It's a long story but he terned attains everyone and uploaded himself int oa brain. And hes an ass. Well not an acutal ass, but a brain. We will fix this. Hes alive but im worred I may have to kill him.

>Love you little sister.

My letter to Meriele:

>Hi, Meriele

>This is to be read after Elora's letter. Hopefully it makes some sense.

>We found Himo. He has not been great. We do not exactly understand why, but he made a pact with a people called githyanki to be turned into a giant brain, which would work as the pilot for one of their ships. He appears to have been consumed by his desire to help Cyre win the war. He wanted Elora to join him, so he is still himself, but I think he doesn't fully comprehend the consequences of the Mourning.
>
>Since we were not welcome in that ship, we had to fight our way out and he was in the way. He escaped, so he is still alive. We will need to do some research into the githyanki/githzerai tradition, but there could be a way to revert the change. No promises.

>Can't wait to see you.

We are to meet with BB at the warforged's asteroid in a month (3 days in the astral sea).

In the meantime, we are going to check out that ice castle on the way to Rhukaan Draal. But first we need to find our ship. We found her in a cave. The Deep Mara Cavern. She is missing a hand! Has a hook now.

She intercepted some pirates and took their cargo. Technically not piracy, I guess. She ended up in this place and has been waiting here since. She lost her hand while touching some "black things". It's a sphere of annihilation. WHAT?! Cannith is producing spheres of annihilation and selling them?! Elly got 26 of them.

Do we need to go back to the asteroid to get the sphere from BB still? Probably not anymore. Hmmâ€¦

Elora decided to scry on Control with True Seeing. She saw the queen and looked like a changeling as her true self.

We also decided maybe we're not going to go through with the contract from the Storm Lords. They wanted us to eradicate the drow so that they could mine the resources there. Don't like it one bit.

Elly wants to sell the loot she got. Fair enough, it's hers.

We took 4 of the spheres of annihilation with us. Hopefully we can pass by the Mournland and destroy some colossus on our way to the ice castle.

I spent some time with the armour trying to understand what it is that needs to happen to unlock another feature. The boots have something interesting to them. Maybe running a certain distance with them?

While on our way to Khorvaire, we decided to stop at Bikini Atoll to test a way to destroy spheres of annihilations. Abel and Elora are going to put a sphere of annihilation next to each other. Abel will deliberately fail the check to control the sphere of annihilation farther away from here, causing it to go towards her and crash into the other sphere. Then Elora will teleport both of them away. Hopefully we don't destroy Khorvaire.

The largest explosion I have ever seen came after. The shock wave hit us but didn't damage the ship. And it appears we managed to destroy them. That was successful!

After several days we finally arrived at Rhukaan Draal. We will be researching the Outsiders.

Got a response from Meriele. It sounds like Karrnath is really wanting to take the Talenta Plains back. She was talking about rumours of war. We should speak to the chiefs, maybe they need help getting people out.

We got to the library. Mored was the librarian. He did remember us from the last time we visited General Nordar. Mored knew about the Outsiders. He came with an armful of scrolls.

Lore dump:

Daelkyr: God-like beings. Or at least of god-like powers. Original from Zorat. The gatekeepers (orcs), believe they came from somewhere else (thus outsiders). They brought abominations and monsters from the real from whence they came. The gatekeepers managed to kill one of the Outsiders, but it returned almost immediately. This is a 9000 year old war.

The githzerai appeared later, from the sky in ships like monsters. They were also fighting the Outsiders. They taught the gatekeepers about the Outsiders. They believed there were 7 of them. The belief is that they came to Eberron as avatars and not in their true form. Imprisonment appears to be the only way to contain them, as death does not. They managed to imprison 3, they are in Khyber. The githzerai imprisoned 4. Magic was used to close the manifest zones that linked Zorat and Eberron. That means the githzerai could no longer come here either. They believe what happened in Lharvion last year has broken the seals.

Quilon was one of the four imprisoned by the githzerai. He's the one Himo (Elora's father) spoke with.

If the Outsiders get free, war will arrive at Eberron.

- Xos under the Demon Wastes. No exact location is known.
- Jedra is in a Khyber cavern western Karnwood, Karrnath. (near the ice castle)
- Vaster under Karthoon Tor, Drooam.

The ones the githzerai have are the following:

- Vral'a'yak
- Riman
- Xanin
- Quillon: Which we saw and apparently spoke with Himo.

I think these are the Lords of Dust.
