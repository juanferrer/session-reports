Back in Eberron, I spent some time studying the cleaver we got from Riman. The cleaver apparently is sentient and has a bloodlust. Probably best to destroy it. But I don't know how just yet.
Meanwhile RIP and Abel were checking the haversack and book we got from Riman.
Abel mentioned it has the ritual for the First Unveiling. Quite gruesome.
Then the bag… it turns meat into coin and coin into meat. But not consumable so… sounds useless. Unless you're a murderer or something.

Anyways, we went to the Astral Sea to message Abel's sister and inform him of our fight with Riman. Then travelled to Krona Peaks, got a few things we needed for the fight, Elora used wish to create Belora. At this rate we'll have a second party in no time. Last thing before bed was a fantastic heroes' feast from RIP. And then we were off to Xoriat.

As soon as we got there, an orderly saw Elora and she managed to convince him to take her to her room. The fight dragged a bit, as one of the nurses heard the fighting noises. We almost didn't make it.

But we did…

Jedra's room was trippy. Lots of mirrors and checker patterns on the floor that seemed to flow into holes. Belora got turned into a goat and BIP caused an earthquake, smashing all of the mirrors. Jedra also caused a clone of himself to appear out of one of the mirrors (before they were broken).
