We asked NorrDog about Landro, but he was not reacting. We think it's inactive. Instead we're going to Arkus, in Metrol.

The Queen/Control called us telling us about a warrant for our arrest in Korth. House Deneith won't comply with the warrant. Yay, I guess. 2k bounty.
She asked us to speak with Nordar and ask her to stop destroying the colossus. She wasn't happy with us when we refused.

When we arrived at Metrol, NorrDog wasn't able to find Arkus. We will land to try and find it. City looks abandoned, but there seems to be some activity from the creatures we saw when we were last here. They're all over now, as the re-forged were kind of keeping them at bay. Now that they're gone, the city is all theirs.

We approached one of the hangars where they stored/built ships. We got in with the portable hole (leaving the bag of holding behind, as we always do). Inside it was pitch black. Couldn't see a thing. We walked for a bit and noticed some footprints. Nearby we saw the scaffolding about the height of a colossus, but it was empty. Then we heard a voice, coming from a skinny humanoid.

> "The doors are locked. 6 cheese, 4 locked, 1 escaped. 8, then 3 suitcases. 5 fingers on his hand. Hangar 9. 1 pudding. Oops, 11. There's 6. 12 eyes."

I catched him. He couldn't see me, but I saw he had a dragonmark. House Cannith. I asked him about Arkus, to which he responded. "He was here. But he was gone all along". "The man with the eyes". "Not a beholder" "The man with the white glowing eyes". The Lords of Dust!

His name is Ermin. The man with the glowing eyes took Arkus.
The man was saying his shift ends at one. Abel noticed the clock in his office said 12:30. She advanced it to 13:00 and waited. He noticed the hour, accepted we were the replacement and walked out of the warehouse. We kind of played it like our shift was also over and
Guard warforged in the middle. "Very important for the war effort".

General Nordar called. They have located a colossus at Barren Keep. Destroyed, C-Pad detonation. One in Cirport too. Destroyed. Undoer, near Tronish is damaged. They're sending a battalion to fully destroy it.
A local contact in Rekkensmithy. A trapper named Zardak. They have provided information to the Ker'Zerath over the years. They inform the order of Nordad about . He will be in the tavern, Egret Nothing.

Nordar was gossiping with us. She said the Queen is not as stable as she once was. Prince Orgath, after visiting the queen, died in an accident in the lightning rail. Died in the fire. No foul play suspected after an investigation from Breland. Yeah, sure. Will need to look into that…

Ah, turns out I misremembered the numbers. This is the correct sequence:

```
1, 3, 4, 1, 6, 8, 3, 5, 9, 1, 11, 6, 12
```

We think it's an epidiascope prophecy. After checking, this is what the prophecy said.

> "When the indivisible is mirrored thirty and six futures are shown.  Between the twelfth blind man and an age of rest there lies a change in position and a truth untold."

Anyways, we dropped Ermi with the Brelish army and went north to Rekkensmithy to speak to the contact. We stopped by Flamekeep to buy some stuff we needed. I got the Eberron-infused copper and an air elemental.

I found out how they gather air elementals. They usually go to manifest zones for the plane of air, where air elementals naturally exists and they capture them and send them over to be sold. 100g/elemental. Just too cheap…

Abel helped me finish fixing the broom. We got a new elemental ring and the casing for the elemental and the broom started up. Nice!

Elora scryed on Control. She was looking at some paperwork, a man approached her. She looked and asked him "Is he secured?". He replied "Yes, ma'am", and left. Elora also noticed a word in one of the documents: "Dreadhold". Lhazaar Principalities.
Is that where they are keeping the prince?!

Elly knows a lot of people there. And Pan knows the history, so we're probably going there somewhere.

We landed near Rekkenmark. Place was full of snow and empty of people. We went to the tavern, as instructed. Before going in we disguised ourselves to be totally unrecognisable. To establish our cover story, we took care of some rats on his basements. We think he cooked them and served them in the animal stew. Hmm…

We found our contact. I think she was in disguise too. She told us about the icy spire fortress. Appeared during the Mourning. Count said no one was to go north. Some people were sent up to deal with the assumed bandits, but they never returned. Reinforcements were requested, but nothing yet. Ice warriors have been seen.
Her family has been keeping an eye on the area for the Ker'Zerath. They're looking out for any evil stuff (Emerald Claw or something like that). She doesn't think the spire itself is evil. 500ft. in diameter. Heavily patrolled, 6 towers with a big one in the centre. Main entrance is on the east side. Probably a spring north of it, maybe a way in. Dangerous animals around.

The animal stew was awful.

We flew to the spire and made our plans. Elora's sneaking in while I follow. We parked the ship, walked about a kilometre and then started sneaking. Spire looked like ice or stone. Wall is about 50 ft. tall. Several towers on the inside. There is one figure guarding from the top of the wall.
We almost freeze there. Came back with the tail between our legs to get some warmer clothes. Who would have thought the ice castle would be cold?!

Anyways, Abel didn't have seeming prepared, so we funded Elly for a night out and asked her to get us some warm clothes.
