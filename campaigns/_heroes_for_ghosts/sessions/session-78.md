Elora kind of lost it when she peered into the Daelkyr's mind, so we left. As we arrived, there was a scene of war. Lots of people fighting, bleeding and dying. Immediately after we were hit by a fireball and things got ugly.

We almost got killed, but managed to kill them first. Abel queried the captured soul of one of the attackers. She asked how many troupes had been sent to infiltrate the castle. The soul replied "39". I don't think we'll be able to take them all.

We went looking for the prince and found him about to win a fight with the invaders. He asked us to help his people outside.

We saw the ship we boarded last time we were in the Astral Sea. On the ground, almost everyone was dead, but we saw Mahari among the living.I went straight for her… but didn't get very far. As I got to her she cast Power Word: Pain on me and was made almost useless. Still got her a few times, but they knocked me out. Then Abel brought the big guns. She cast Dominate Person and started healing us and telling the big ship with the invaders to retreat, as the fight was lost.

RIP started casting Geas to tell her to protect Abel for 30 days. Elora used Otto's Irresistible Dance to keep her dancing and I attacked, of course.

And… the plan worked. Now we have our own Mahari chilling with us.

We also discovered that they don't have legendary resistance unless they're together.
