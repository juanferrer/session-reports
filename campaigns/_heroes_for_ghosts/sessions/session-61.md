We decided to stay one more day to get some ropes and harpoons installed. We went to check the proto-forged that got itself in jail. We paid its bail and told them to stay out of trouble and ask for permission before doing things.

Abel did some research into her legendary item and we got ready to go. We called the Baron to get some info on how to communicate with other ships. In case we are unable to do so, the protocol is to have each ship turn to its left (away from each other).

We left Korth and travelled towards the Scions Sound. Elora scried on Black Elly, she was with her pirate crew having dinner and discussing the loot they got from the Ossory(?), a ship they raided.

When we passed Taer Syraen, which doesn’t appear to be a city, but a sort of icy forest. Fanciful-looking fortification, it appears made of ice. Stories about the forest being the home of winter. These were fairy tales until the day of the Mourning, when the fortress appeared. There are rumours of some knights spreading winter and death. Neighbouring countries have tried to establish contact with the town, but to no success. We definitely need to check out the place.

Stormhome was home to house Lyrandar’s enclave. It’s become the biggest skyport we’ve ever seen, a favourite tourist destination.

Elora scried on Elly again and she kind of located her east of us. We’re going that way.

Turns out we found the Ossory floating on the sea… They wanted to get on our ship, no intention to save their ship. Very suspicious. They gave me fish! Even more suspicious. We went back to the Duckess to make some calls and I checked the fish was not poisoned. But it’s all very suspicious. Baron d’Lyrandar gave us the name of the captain, which was different than the one we met. So I wasn’t wrong!

Elora dimension doored down into the lower deck and found the actual crew, bound and gagged. Elora freed them and they organised an attack. 6 seconds and it was done. The ship took out their anger on one of the goblins and tied up the rest.

We waited for Elly’s ship for a while. Finally, we saw a storm approaching, which we guessed was where the other ship was. They got under our ship and started firing their wands.

Elora jumped down and tried to calm her down. Abel cast anti-gravity and it all went crazy. People started flying off the ship, I tried to blink down, but fell up towards the bottom of our ship. Such a hero…
