In Henge we found 13 structures arranged in a circle made of the same black material we have been seeing around here. In a circle within, there are another 13 structures with some magic swirls inside them. Not all are full and one of them has a different magic thingy. Black energy. Eyes? Maybe madness. Definitely madness.
Varhoe translated the runes.
- Kythri Coterminous
- Dal Quor Isolated
- Xorait Waxing/Waning/Coterminous/Isolated/Error 13

If the witches are in Amber, we should be careful.
Got to Amber Research Centre. There was a sign saying "Consciousness Enforcement Protocol active", whatever that is. There was a note on the side of the console prompting for a password that had the following words crossed out: "Ice Hill Cloud Stone Fire". The password was "Storm". Level two is on lockdown.

We found a room that allowed us to swap sizes between two things. Scalar Transposition was the name.. Adrik grew to Elora’s size and vice-versa. We changed after.
Then we found a room that had an obelisk like the one we saw in Stormreach. There was also a ziggurat and a screen that was playing a video of a giant talking about how to create a sphere of annihilation. Something about combining spells and dragon shards to create a "nothing" sphere, a sphere of void.
There was another disk about the same giant. He said that ziggurats are a giant device used to align or separate planes to ease travel. They need to be attuned to the target plane using runes inscriptions and their positions.
Next room had a similar setup as the room of the scalar transposition mechanism, but it was for Consciousness Transportation. Oh, my… Elora and RIP changed consciousness. RIP could smell! And taste! And Elora just wanted to stare at us.
Next room had a stairs leading up (the level on lockdown), but we decided to continue and come back to it.
In the last room there were three giant capsules, one empty, one with a giant skeleton and one with a giant in cryostasis. We are waking up the other giant. Sludnar was his name. They were attacked by dragons and he wanted to preserve himself.
Sludnar talked about the precursor being some rock (maybe the black material?). They cast spells for each of the 
Toquill called also. Apparently he designed the machine for the Warforged.
We went through the rest of the rooms (water, fire and earth) and then reached the elevator.
