After getting into the dungeon, we manage to lure out the boss of the placeâ€¦ with two guards. Elora goes with him into his office (for some sexy time), the guards find us and we fight them. One gets killed, the other is spared. Elora fights the boss and, as we get in, we paralyse him, and start searching the place. RIP finds a chest that is enchanted and starts getting aggressive.

The chest contained the following and it now follows us.

- Folded pair of curtains
- Oak stool
- Stuffed worg
- Deck of Cards

We travelled to Groshk, delivered the bandit and travelled on to Rhukaan Draal, where we bought some magic items. We then travelled to New Cyre.

Note: Make goals list somewhere.
Adrik wants to build a tavern when he retires. They are around 7k in a good location. Most reputable taverns in Khorvaire are licensed by House Ghallanda. I probably want to make friends with some of them.
