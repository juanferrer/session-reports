We continued through the dungeon and found a corridor with a door. As Elora's character, Ono, opened it, she found two skeletons and started dealing with them with the help of RIP's character, Loose Screws. Mirit (Abel's character) and Gogar (mine) moved on to the next room and went to find the treasure as quickly as possible. There's only one hour, and we need to win this! We tried all doors and Abel used her lockpicks on a few of the doors. There was a grate door that I bypassed using wild shape. A huge spider came down from the ceiling and we fought it. Loose Screws almost dies.
We walked through the plank on top of the water "icy like the grave" into a room with a crown and a sarcophagus. Ono nailed it shut and Mirit took the crown. In that room we also found one of the statue heads for the puzzle in the main room. We went through and found 4 zombies in the next room. Abel and I rushed down the stairs and found the last chest. Mirit took the golden tricorn that was in the chest and we started running. A banshee appeared from behind the chest and started chasing us. As we got to the top of the stairs we saw that Elora had ragequit and RIP was pretty low, so we decided to book it. As we were leaving, the banshee was at the top of the stairs and used her wail and we all died. That's a bit broken, not gonna lie. Needs rebalancing. In the end we received no points for that game.

After that we had the Skiff Race. As we walked in, Fappelstamp was walking out of our boat. We just knew he had done something, so we thoroughly checked the boat and sure enough he had booby-trapped one of the cannons with live ammunition! Was he trying to get himself killed? Anyways, we fixed everything and got ready to mess with them. RIP used his horn of silent alarm, Gogar cast Dust Devil and got ready to man one of the cannons. Elora cast Bigby's hand and RIP used Control Water to slow them down. In short, we cheated a lot. But no one found out, luckily.

As we crossed the first checkpoint, an inflatable crocodile came out of the water and a bunch of people were paddling it towards our boat. Elora spoke with it and made it turn towards the other ship and it started attacking them. Same thing happened shortly after when the kraken, which hadn't been seen since "the incident back in '95", came out of the water. I spoke to it this time and pointed him to the slayer of his children, the other boat. It went there and attacked them. As soon as the kraken attacked them, the ship sank.

Needless to say, we won.

We had a rest and the next day we sailed out to another island: Pirate Fest Treasure Island! This is a last man standing thing. We'll have to win this one!

By the way, we know the Dreadhold is manned by dwarves from House Kundarak (banking). They see it as punishment.
