After the bone monster reappeared, it was debuffed to hell and Adrik was heavily buffed. He killed it in one hit dealing 63 damage! After that two beaky-tentacle monsters with their brains exposed. They stormed Able and killed her in one turn! We killed them and RIP cast revivify, but she lost a finger. After the fight we had a rest and went around looking for the missing warforged. We found two corpses and one alive. On the way back from the Palace of Earth, we stopped by the Palace of Wind and opened the frosty door. It lead to a blizzard with a green and blue moon .

I finished the feather carving on the guard. Put on a leather around the grab and finished putting one of the purple crystals that we found in the Palace of Earth as the pommel. Looks lovely, just needs casting the spell now. The next day I cast shield on the sword. 1 success.

We found a 10 ft. tall Warforged in the crater that would be the centre of the Mourning. The Sachem is also known as the "Lord of Blades". A gnome by the name of Madam Duxe Penne built a device for them to be able to fly higher than other airships currently permit. The idea is to get to the ring of Siberys and out into the Astral Sea, aiming for the moons.

RIP communed with the Gods and asked the following things.

"Will we find a sphere of annihilation in the vault?" No
"Are the Sachem's motives true?" Yes
"Will he help us find Abel's brother?" Yes
