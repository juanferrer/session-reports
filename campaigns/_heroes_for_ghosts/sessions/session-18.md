We finally arrived to Lostflats. We found a corpse being eaten by some dinosaurs. He was recognised by the guards as Pomoroi. House Jorasco is making the refugees work to produce ingredients for medicine and potions. They sound like a cult, always saying "community" and stuff.
Turns out Pomoroi was poisoned. By the community! Sounds like The Village play from Shyamalan. They are also giving some tarbeast to the people, probably to keep them working their 20-hour shift!
In the end we decided to have dinner with them. We managed to avoid the main meal, but dessert was only purified. They cast a spell on us and Adrik was charmed, wanting to stay and help the community. Able cast dispel magic, so all went well. We were sent to work the next day, Adrik and Elora went to the fields, Able was in the laboratory and RIP was in the hospital. RIP was sent to bury the body and, as he went outside, he set fire to the hospital.
