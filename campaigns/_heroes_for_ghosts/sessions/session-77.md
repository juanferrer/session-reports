We were going through the prophecies and noticed this one:
"There comes a day when the red lady reveals her true self, no man shall mark the rise of two empires and an end to the monarchy"
We also remembered the "Queen" was wearing a red dress on the day of her "coronation" (i.e. ).

For the record: the Lords of Dust are not the same as the Daelkyr. Quillion is one of the Daelkyr.

Elly enjoyed her day and got our warm clothes.

We parked the ship about a mile away from the castle and walked towards Taer Syraen, the Fae Spire. Hopefully we can just talk it out with them.

RIP recognised the footprints to be in a group of eight, riding horses and with another creature which we believe could be a yeti.
Aniways, we decided to find that spring that could take us under the castle. We bumped into a polar bear, which we managed to scare away and three huge dragons (not really) that Elora tricked into thinking there was some food behind them.

As we reached the stream and were considering how to go through, a strange, slithery worm/snake came for us. They almost kill Abel and Pan, but we managed.

We went through the tunnel we found and reached the end and found ourselves in a sort of tank. There was a water-made creature. She, Faxia, was confused when we came out of the tank. When she asked who we were, Elora told her a heavily embellished story about our time with the giants.
She works for Shanseren. She told us her lord has been preoccupied in the last couple of years. They usually move the castle every so often. Apparently they've been having trouble with moving the castle out of this place, so we offered our help.  She grabbed some water, took it to the kitchen and told us how to get to the main hall. The cook came out of the kitchen and assumed we were there to help, so we did.

I helped cool the soup (who wants cold soup?!), Elora cooked (spiked, rather) the steak, Abel prepared the drinks and RIP got the desserts ready.

With dinner ready, we headed over to the grannies. Three ancient hags were making offers on how to keep me, the "child warforged".

They gave us some "boons", although "booms" were on the table. Abel got rabbit ears, RIP got a frog familiar, I got three unlabeled bottles, Elora had a bad makeover (clown-like).

When asked, they suggested we show respect to the Lord. They also mentioned he's been worried about the castle being stuck here.

We went the way Faxia showed us and found a bird-like creature which we thought was the lord. It didn't speak to us, but we showed respect anyways. And the lord pooped on the floor. Strange customs, but we figured this is not the lord. Maybe a warden? There were some cells in this room as well. One of the prisoners was a human and the other one was a fae (Spark). Spark polymorphed the prince into a boar, so they are kept imprisoned.

The lord is a very handsome blue fae prince. As we continued wandering, we found such handsome blue prince.
We shared with him info about the prophecies and he seemed interesting. He suggested we have dinner together. It was a heroes' feast. We had some very interesting drinks as well. Drunk Uncle, Treant Tea, Hairy Wizard and Ice Wine.

He told us the story of how they got here. They are a fae spire. They often travel to different planes, usually for a few days at a time. This time it was unintentional. They were "pulled" here nearly 4 years ago and haven't been able to leave ever since. A portal appeared in the cellar when they arrived. It leads into a Khyber pocket. An entity dwells there, very dangerous. A Daelkyr. They are the Spire of the Book, which is the symbol of Thelenis. He suggested Fernia, the plane of Fire, is the Anvil. If we're going there, he said to visit the City of Brass.

He took us to view the portal. Abel sensed some discord coming from the portal. She also studied it with her mask on.

We decided to rest and study the portal and go through the next day.

We went through the portal and found this trapped Daelkyr, Ghedra. Elora asked them if he had seen our show and he said he loved it. And that he had seen the end. !!

He was bound centuries ago during a ritual with 13 orc druids (Nordar's order). Elora saw this while probing the Dalekyr's mind. As she was doing this, she felt the need to perform for Ghedra. I stopped her just in time, but she was going to play the Strat.
