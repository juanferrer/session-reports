Iron, Elora's replacement, got here and we convinced him to help us. He didn't even ask for money!
We decided to use the brooms to get to shore, sneak into a tavern the guards frequent in Gaolgate Town and steal an unlock token from them. We will then climb the infirmity tower and be in there by 7am, with the rest of the prisoners
As we went in, Krek started talking with one of the guards. She figured out they carry them in a chain. We "helped" one of them to our room and Krek slit his throat, got his token and we cleaned the room.
As we got downstairs, Iron was talking about his desire to kill the dwarves. He scared some people, but wasn't taken by the guards.
We decided to "go to bed", but we snuck out the window. Iron fell on the water and after he encountered a dwarf outside he confronted him about bullying the creatures/inmates. He punched him, grabbed him and jumped off the dock. Came out alone after a few minutes.
In the cover of night, we got to the western tower, on the wall facing the sea and Krek flew up to the top, tied a rope and the rest of us climbed up. We were initially going to sneak past the dwarf dwarfing (?) the siege want, but we needed his key, so we quickly murdered him and threw his body off the side. Not to the sea, though. He fell on the rocks and splattered there.
Finally, we got in. Now to the infirmary!

In the infirmary we met Ruth, which is the chaplain of the prison. She was happy and confused to see Iron and Krek. We explained a bit of what we're doing and asked her to remain silent.
Horrak, Gwylennâ€¦ We got some names for dwarves that work in the gold ward.
We went through the elevator and got to Iron's favourite floor. We walked around for a bit and encountered a dwarf fixing one of the washing machines. Iron pushed him in and turned the machine off. He was shredded to bits. After a bit we checked his remains and found a mangled key amulet.

As we were going through the laundry floor, two more guards came up in the elevator. We attacked them, but they stunned me and one of them almost escaped in the elevator.

We're on 6 guards so far.
