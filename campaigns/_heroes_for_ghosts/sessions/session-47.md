They're going to the boat. We tried to trick them, but couldn't. They wanted to take us to Big Mama Orden, but it didn't work out. We ended up fighting them and killing one. The other one surrendered and offered to take us to Big Mama

Varhoue found behind the throne a text saying the following:

```
A look that isn't broken
A case that doesn't open
A landing when nothing flew
```

A Khyber entrance? Stair is the key!
There are passages that go to other places in the world. We followed what looked like a giant lightning rail. After travelling for the entire day, we reached another station. We entered and found some drow examining a slab. We fought them and found the following code:

> CXMNV-LOCKF-DLMQK-VYTIP-PZFAI-YATWA-KVOJG-YEUHV-LISCC-KRSOR

The Matron (of the drow) is a spellcaster. That's what one of the drow said, but we had to kill him after that.
