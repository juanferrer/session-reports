As soon as we were lighting the last candle, we appeared back in the Tikka's lair.
Fight started getting difficult. Abel invoked Hasanas' contract, for the second part. Is her soul now his? Oh, noâ€¦ 4 tannarukks and an orthon appeared. 4 monsters from Hasanas, I assume. I was deafened during this, so I was very confused why they were attacking the Tikka.

When we killed the Tikka, the blonde guy showed up again. He introduced himself as Quellin. He told us "the others" were coming, so we put the tikka meat in the bags and were about to leave when one of these demons found some items in the nest in the middle.

He said the Sisters are some of the people working for him. I think he's one of the Lords of Dust.

We left the cave, made our way to the portal, did the ninja jump through the portal and then got back to the ship. Bebe did not trust our guests, but took us to Sanctum anyways. We delivered the tikka meat and got directions for where to find Abel's brother. We should ask around in The Grove, a githzerai stronghold near Rhaan. If not, we could check Eye, where they spotted a githzerai ship. Abel's brother was with three other: Messer (half-elf), Tai (human) and Cutlass (warforged).

RIP asked some questions about building a new refuelling station. He's thinking of a place for Sachem's lot. The bossman offered us to keep the ship Abel's brother stole for 100 hours and RIP made a counteroffer: the other 500 pounds of tikka meat. He loved the offer. He also said we should check Phoenix for more info on mining and building materials.

Elora asked around and found an asteroid that is very safe, although a bit mined out. We plan to stop there on our way to Eyre and activate the quick teleportation circle.

As I was checking out the plants on the deck and studying it, I saw a flicker of light. Something reflecting light. Abel checked it out and it looked like a deep-sea fish. Apparently it's a githyanki attack ship! Bebe pressed the alarm and we all got in position.

We started running away, as there were two ships. We managed to lose the first one, so we decided to turn on the other one. We were overpowering them, so they turned to leave. I performed a high-G manoeuvre, which put us in medium range and Elora destroyed their engines.

In spite of Bebe's recommendation, we decided to board them and see what was up. We got received by a fireball and decided to maybe not speak with them so much.
