Unveilings:

- 2nd: Revealed by Felix, the Mathematician (Man of Numbers). A library of forbidden knowledge. If we enter the library against the librarian's wishes, we need to form a magic circle. Delve into the arcane texts to find the necessary instructions and the law to arrange the symbols.
- 3rd: Revealed by Linda, the Weeper. Related to the Chapel. We will need to come back for it.
- 4th: Revealed by Irina, the Collector. Related to the Surgery. Circle revealed to Abel.
- 5th: Revealed by ?. Related to the Treatment Room. Circle found in Xakin's book.
- 6th: Revealed by ?. Related to. Circle found in Jedra's book
- 7th. Revealed by the Director (Puppet Master). In the heart of the asylum, there is the machine. There, we will witness the seventh unveiling. We will need to use the machine to alter reality and have brought about what we wish this place to be. We must complete the other six unveilings before attempting the seventh.

We had some downtime as we prepared to find Quillion and his partner.
RIP received a sending message from the Daughters asking to deliver the heads of the dispatched Dael'kyr. Abel took us there.

We were received by the Daughters, but also the full Chamber (Toquill and his colleagues). They noticed Belora's true form of a dragon and asked to see her true colours. As she transformed into a dragon, the other did the same. We saw the whole Chamber in their true form, but also the Daughters, who transformed into some kind of feathered dragon. That was a surprising discovery.
After introducing themselves they gave us Val'arak's book and the key to the machine room. Nice! They also informed us that they are in Quillion's chamber attempting to create a substitute Dael'kyr. They urged us to get to them quickly, as they were very close to succeeding.
Belora asked if it would be possible for her to join the Chamber with the other dragons and they said it could be considered.
We left for Krona Peaks, did some shopping and prepared for the day ahead. Heroes' Feast at night and Elora's Cul'Strat's melody accompanying Abel's story about Sweetie, a half-orc that was found by a halfling family and made to fight in an arena for money. Sounds like child abuse, but she sounds happy.

Anyways, we went to the asylum and headed for the machine room. After a quick and uneventful fight with two orderlies, we reached the machine room. We found the librarian, Mr. Xanathar, who was taking some books back to "His Lordship". His favourite book, in fact. We asked him to give us the book, as we were going that way anyways. He didn't buy it. We asked him to not tell them we were coming, as it was kind of a surprise. I think he did believe that one.
