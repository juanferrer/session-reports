We found a refugee to tell their story by the name of Milt Hugrin.
The judges were:

- Lath Thul - Good
- Lath Lashu - lizardfolk. Suspicious. Will take some convincing
- Lath Golfound - Lazy, not a good choice
- Lath Erediri - Bored, difficult to keep his attention
- Lath Ranguth - Young female. Outspoken, “a character”
- Lath Sefrass - Middle aged male. Good.
- Lath Halkeras - Human, serious and stern. Likely to control the jury

The top of the house, “Valgen d’Jorasco”, architected the whole plan. Zelon Jorasco was Lath Sharbul’s contact.

We destroyed the defence. They even called us to testify and they asked everyone the wrong questions. When they asked Adrik “did you set fire to the hospital?”. Adrik said “No”. That broke them.

It was mentioned that there’s a warforged in the Mournland that, apparently, said “Death to all fleshies”. Sounds dangerous.
We also saw Control there (the elf woman we saw at the start).
