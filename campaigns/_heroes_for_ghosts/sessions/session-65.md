Well, I’m very confused. A lot has happened and we seem to be around a lot of strange creatures.
I finished clearing the engine room and went to look for the rest of the party. They killed some sort of giant pink mouse with several tongues. I think they found the sensors they were looking for. On the way out, we encountered some green, spongy creature that attacked us. Apparently Able had eaten some on the way in. I should not leave them alone, they get reckless. RIP blighted and the thing screamed as it withered into nothingness.

At the end of the day, we came back to report to Bebe. Abel cast alarm to alert us if the creature there leaves.

Looking at the map I noticed a few things, so I started asking questions
Bebe is from Reverie station. Abel’s brother is probably at Sancus Station, so we’re going there.
Lharvion is surrounded by some crazy event area. Strange stuff starts happening. Also some Githyanki (space drow) roaming the area, so it’s very dangerous. Bebe also said it appeared to be growing bigger, but it’s not actually moved. 

Abel and Elora had some bad dreams last night. During breakfast we noticed glassiness on their eyes and bruises on their back. Bebe said it was a disease transmitted by some fungus. He was about to sacrifice them when RIP cured them with Lesser Restoration. 

After breakfast we went to the lower deck to deal with the grichlich. As we were looking for them in the place, one jumped on Able and started sucking at her. The other one was trying to get to me, but I grabbed it and started hacking at it. Elora turned the other one into a malformed platypus. We got them exterminated with the ship’s engine and went back to check for more of those creatures.

Nearing the end of the to-do list, we mended and reattached the solar sail with the help of a nice welding torch from Bebe. I’ve heard of this, but never seen them. This could be very, very useful. We fixed the pump as well, we’re now ready to go.

Pan used the cubic gate to drop the previous footage and get some blanks for the next few days. He came back looking like an old man. He said 100 years had passed. We all got really scared of having skipped so much time, but it turns out it was a prank. 10 days had passed, which is still a lot of time, but hopefully we won’t be here long.

As we were preparing for launch I sat at the tactical console, ready to command the weapons on the ship. RIP was on the other one, which I can’t quite remember what it was for. We left the asteroid and towards the refuelling station, and then towards Sancus Station.

Apparently the refuelling station is where Bebe’s crew got infected. He said only 4 engineers are there, so they probably are dead now. Also, the infecting “form” of these creatures is different from the one that “hatches” (macabre, but I can’t find a better word). Bebe called them “big teeth”. It’s gonna be fun. As we arrived, Bebe confirmed the worst case scenario: 4 big-teeth and however many infecting forms as there were at the start.

Here’s the plan:
- Check air is pressurised
- Check air is good
- If either is false, we need to restore power
 - Main airlock, crew quarters, power and life support, processing and storage

After some tense moments holding our breath. We found the power and life support unit, started it and then went to start making fuel. Then the Xenomorphs arrived.
