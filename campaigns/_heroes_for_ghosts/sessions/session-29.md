The north door was connected to some dimension of fire. We decided to put the Sphere back in until we finished searching the palace. As it closed, we broke the door on closing it! We found a document mentioning they had to fix another lock, so there's maybe another Sphere on that one. However, they mentioned someone may have taken some runes to the Palace of Light, so we're checking there. 22 is disappointed now.
In the Palace of Light we found a statue with the likeness of the queen at the back of a hall of mirrors. As we got in, we got confused with the reflections and started seeing things. Adrik saw his family and said "Papa? I'm sorry I left, papa". Then he started forgetting their faces. Their faces were gone, just skin covering their featureless faces. After covering his eyes, he followed Elora's voice to find his way back. He will never look at mirrors again.
In

A briefing for the queen about reaching out to the sisters in Droaam. Maybe should arrange an attack on Breland and offering western Breland as a payment. Another reason to get in touch with the Sisters.


In the ballroom we saw something like echoes from the past. Elora found the Archmage, which said something about... "experiments breeding humans"?! "Living prisoners"!?!?!?!?
I don't know if we were affecting the past, but Elora pranked the archmage by putting his hat and (fake) hair in the soup. Elora remembered her uncle telling her about this event. Are we affecting the past? Or did this always happen?

Able thinks the Watchers are part of these experiments breeding humans the archmage talked about. They may be the result of these experiments.
We rested for the night and found some rooms for guests and stuff. We also found a gap between the rooms which did fit a spying quarter. There were logs about conversations between the guests
