C wants us to let her know if Toquill contacts us again.
We want to exchange info with her about the evil warforged and the ziggurat and the githyanki.
Githyanki: There was a war between them and their masters before the arrival of the humans and elves. General Nodar's ancestors helped win that war.
Warforged: "Death to the fleshies". "Lord of Blade". Maybe rumours, maybe truth, no one's sure.

We worked out a goor arrangement with Sivis for our image rights.

We traveled to the Mournland and started to go in (Water Walking and Water Breathing helped us on the way). Two creatures appeared, but Able got us out of trouble by using Control Water to get a huge wave to sweep us out. The creatures missed out on lunch. But we missed out on the treasure! =(
We took a short rest and teeth started to rain.

After we started walking to Metrol, we somehow got stuck in a space loop. We couldn't progress any way we went. Then we heard some children singing a creepy song. It seemed to be a puzzle. We moved North, East, South, South, West and North (after a lot of experimentation). When we completed the loop, we got out of the loop. Then we saw a dog that seemed to be zoned out. Abel touched it and it turned into grubs, who dug into her leg! She misty stepped away and got rid of them, luckily.
