Also, is Sivis getting live feedback from the scry cam?

We fought the beholder, I jumped on top of it after almost dying. RIP blinded it and we destroyed him.

We also found a device projecting a constellation with text in draconic. It has 13 rings with runes on it. This is the epidiascope! We noted the current combination.

We did some fatal damage to the queen so that she couldn’t be unpetrified. Elora said she was guilty of many horrible things, so she did that. We faked it as damage during the fight and unpetrified Elora’s mum.

We found some interesting items in the archmage’s office. One of them was an eyeball, which occupied RIPs socket after he pulled his out!

Back in the bank, we opened the northwest vault. Top secret item, apparently.

This is what was written on the first code: "When an orb of power is placed in the vault of air the first may be lost but the second shall be safe."
The second one says: "When one of two is retrieved from the vault of air an abundance of caution may lead to destruction and twenty two despair."

RIP inquired about Sachem to the warforged. He was guided by someone that was not a warforged.
