We couldn't put off Scarlet's return any longer, so we got what we needed for the long trip to the Twilight's Demesne (about 4 days). I was crafting some poison, Abel was learning a spell, RIP prepared his cooking ingredients and Elora offered to shave me. I was due a shave, so why not. She kept some of the beard. Strange… At the end of the second day, she came out with a knock-off of myself! She called him Badrik. He wasn't very capable, but I've been training him and bringing him up to speed with his abilities.

Finally, we arrived at the Eldeen Reaches. Feels like it's always a summer sunset. Very dense forest, we arrived early morning. Still, it feels like a sunset. Abel said she wants to retire here. I wouldn't mind, to be honest. Maybe not right in this place, more like at the edge of the forest.
Abel pulled out the planar rod and tried to figure out how to find the manifest zone. We walked until Scarlet said she started feeling some connection to her home. Abel started atuning andBadrik, Elora and I went for a walk to see the place.
We started noticing face-like patterns on the trees. There was one with emerald eyes near where we were. We approached the tree and it spoke to us! It asked what we were looking at. He said not many people come around. He asked if we like games. We obviously do. He said there's a prize!

He gave us three riddles.

> *I am born in darkness but thrive in light,*
> *I am whispered in secrets, a thief in the night.*
> *I dance with the flame, elusive and fleet. What am I? It is not fire. Fairy was clear and loud with the mocking. No wonder they don't get many visitors. Shadow! Abel guessed it.*

> *I can be cracked, made, told and played. What am I? A joke.*

> *I'm a bridge during the day with colours vivid. I paint the light. A prison of wonders, a sight behold.*
> *In vibrant darks my darkness unfold. What am I? A rainbow*

Once for the next seven nights, we may be lucky when hit, checked or saved. Boon of the Elder Armor: advantage on a hit, check or save once per day for the next seven days.

He doesn't know Splitsprout. But he accepted I plant Splitsprout's seed in the forest.
We stayed up with Abel as she completed the attunement of the planar road.
Abel said to meet with her in the Great Crag so we set off.

RIP messaged Elora's mum, who is now in Trolanport.
We arrived at the Crag, landed and made our twisty way up the tower into the throne room. Abel arrived shortly after us.

Emily Demandy, Control, is ironically out of control. Control's part of the agreement to recognise the territory as a nation brought about parts of the prophecy they had not foreseen. They were using a mistranslation of the prophecy. The original draconic was even more meaningless. She started reading prophecies in draconic, and somehow linked this to the Daelkyr. One that was no longer imprisoned. They believe it has possessed Emily/Control. The Daelkyr can only be killed in Zorat. If we are able to defeat the creature that's possessing Control, we might be able to put things as they were. We need to fight them in Zorat to kill them. They offered to give us some clues on how to unlock the other powers of the Cul'Sir artifacts.

So, kill Control, bring the body back for the Daughters to resurrect, and then go fight the Daelkyr (Vaster) in Zorat. Quillion is also on the loose, so we might as well deal with him too.
The Daughters said killing 3 of the Daelkyr should be enough so that they are no longer a threat. The older or them said Quillion was released by Elora's father. Huh… that's probably why he saved Elora…
We can probably do the same with Elora's dad/Quillion.

- Zoss is imprisoned in the Demon Wastes.
- Jhedra, under the Karnathi forest.
- One of the GIthzerai station
- One in the Grove
- One on a Githzerai ship

Abel also asked about general Nordaar. The Daughters are not part of the Gate Keepers.

Sora Menia helped me unlock some of the features in my power armour. She cast fly on me, and I gained a flying speed. O.O
She asked if I would like to offer my protection to the other members of the party. As a bonus action, I can shield an ally and lose the bonus on myself.

For Elora's ability, we went for a performance in a different plane. We were in the deck of an astral ship, embedded in an asteroid, farther away than we've ever been from Eberron. We reached the celestial sphere, the edge of our universe. It was like the inside of a sphere and there were 2-dimensional creatures, jellyfish, embedded in the sphere. Elora played for them and unlocked the final ability of the Cul'Strat.

When Abel uses the mask's power in the plane of madness, she will gain the ability to shape the world, change things that would have come to pass.

Lastly, RIP. He can now absorb the magical potential of his victims. He can also contain a soul and release it as an ally for a few moments.

They also explained how to release the Daelkyr.

- Draw a magical circle around the prison (with the runes shown)
- Khyber crystals around the circle
- Chant the spell
- 12 shards will be consumed, the thirteenth must have knock cast on it.

RIP had a question, a personal question. He asked if they knew a way to get taste buds, to understand what he was cooking. They agreed amongst themselves, and cast wish and wished for RIP to be able to taste. That was beautiful. I shed a tear.

Abel asked what's the deal between them and the dragons. They said they won't get involved, and endlessly debate the prophecy. The Daughters say the time to debate is long gone, we are at war. Is it the action of a sane person to stand idle while everything dies around us?

We're going to kill Control. And the replacement for Elora's mum.

Abel thinks Lycee is part of the Trust's Triumvirate.

We spent the night in Wroat, Elora talked to some palace guards after their shift and we planned to walk into the palace as tradespeople. After the conversation, we decided to all play as guards coming early to our posts with some work experience interns. And it worked!
We reached the secret passage and found Control to be in her office. Someone just came to bring information about the Dreadhold breakout. They think it was faked. She wrote a fake arrest warrant for stealing state secrets and instructed the guards to take him to the Dreadhold immediately.
After they left, we heard a guttural speech from the other side of the wall. RIP heard two voices, a conversation:

> *"What is our status?"*
> *"The east is ready and the north will be within a day or two"*
> *"We must focus on Xos"*
> *"A third of us will allow us to make an adjustment."*
> *"We will put one of the remaining sisters on it"*
> *"Send both!"*
> *"No one must stay here - we cannot let the agents of the dragon know one of their kin is replaced."*
> *"Very well. But if they fail?"*
> *"We can still take those in the sea but the Githzeri are more experienced. Xos is simpler."*
> *"How is the vessel?"*
> *"All mine. She put up a fight for a while. It was adorable seeing her struggle but I don't think there is anything left to fight now."*
