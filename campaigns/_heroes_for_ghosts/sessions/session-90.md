Guards made breakfast. Delicious dwarven delicatessen. RIP also made a lovely second breakfast, which we will be having down in Deep Ward.
Their file was not correct, by the way. Dude started to cast a spell, but Elora countered it. RIP pushed into the room with antilife shell. Abel used arcane gate to spawn a portal behind the creature and another one on top of the hold monster field. Then Elora used fear, and the creature fell right into the portal. Yay, we caught one!
We decided to do a sweep around the Deep Ward and see what's there.

There was another obelisk. It looks like the giant tech, but different. It appears to be made of the same thing as the ziggurat and the monolith in Xen'Drik. This is probably what's powering the prison's systems. RIP used legend lore and learned about a story usually known only by those of House Kundarak. This probably goes back to Galathar I. They found this setup in this rocky islands. Mages back then realised the obelisk had tremendous capabilities. It had some long-term spells that could hold creatures for a long time. They tapped into it to make the prison. He also found some legends about this being made by the Gate Keepers during their first war against the outsiders (Dalekyr).

Elora used true seeing on herself. Looking at the obelisk became even more unsettling. It appears to warp space-time (Elora had a hard time explaining this). She saw that within five of the crystals there were humanoids. Not inside it, but looking into the crystals she was able to see the creatures. In one of them she saw an immobile Jhedra (one of the Dalekyr, the one under the Fey Spire). She looked into the other crystals and recognised a few of the Dalekyr we know about.
We left the obelisk room and went to speak with the governor (the dead one).

> **Elora**: What do you know about the obelisk room?
> **Dead Governor**: It's only for Kundarak, very important.
> **E**: What makes it important?
> **DG**: Source of power.
> **E**: Can the other two crystals be turned on?
> **DG**: All crystals were lit until recently.
> **E**: How long ago did those crystals go out?
> **DG**: The first crystal went out on the 10th Olarune 996, the second crystal went out on the 13th Rhaan 998.
> **E**: Something went missing in the vault, not sure what. What could go missing of real big value there?
> **DG**: Did they take the crown of Galathar?
> **E**: Sure.

On the 13th of Rhaan we went to visit the sisters and Control was changed. It's also the day we visited Toquill in the dragon's club (the Chamber?). Hmm… The other day is just 10 days before the Treaty of Thronehold.

We had lunch with the new governor. Boiled sausage with dumplings, and fine mead from the Mror Holds. When we asked about the obelisk, he asked if we touched it. He showed us one of his man's hand, which had disappeared. Kind of like a sphere of annihilation.
He also confirmed Quillion (the trickster that saved Elora) was in the first crystal that went out.
Elora was all flirty with him, and then asked about the vaults. The governor said the north tower is the most secure vault they have. Elora managed to swoon him into allowing her to see the vault. Abel followed them, I'm sure dude thought he was getting lucky. Not with the old lady around!

Anyways, he gave them a tour of the place, showed them around and got nothing from Elora. Poor dwarf. We came back later in the afternoon for the documentary. We talked with the guards, some inmates.
Then we went to visit Ermin. He was counting primes, getting stuck at thirteen and then back.

He said *"they put them in [his] head while he was guarding boxes within boxes, locks within locks…"*. The sixth indivisible (sixth prime, 13) in its justified position is the key that's needed to line them up. The boxes? He means the Dalekyr. He recognised us. But not *"in the right boxes"*. He seems to be able to understand fate's fabric. He spent a lot of time with the one of the eyes. Glowing eyes! Abel conjures up an image of Quillion and he recognises him as the master. He came to visit 13. Abel checked the matchboxes and she is certain they are just matchboxes.
He said the boxes are not the point, but what's outside the box. The outsiders. They will come to get it. Then he removed his pants and ran off.
We said our goodbyes to the governor and set off into the sunset. We're on our way to Krona Peaks. Gotta check Kaerra's work! After that, to drop off the fey lady. And then to the Daughters.

Back in Krona Peaks. She said the metal has incredible properties. Sounds like it would be best used in armour and that it could be enchanted in a fraction of the time. I'll try to get some more fernyxium for her.
