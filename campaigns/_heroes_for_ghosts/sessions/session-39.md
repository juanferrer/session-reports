Sachem "apologised" and fixed Pan’s device.
I also got 4 successes on the shield casting for the sword.
Abel used her arcane eye to go to the mine in the crater. She found them digging up a warforged colossus. They seem to be a quarter of the way done, so they still have a time to go.
We left and Abel summoned the demon she was in a pact with. She asked him to send a letter to his brother. He will confirm receipt of the letter.

We’ll go to speak to the sisters and hopefully they have a way for us to reach Xen’Drik.

When we got back to Metrol and went into the vault, we saw a ritual sacrifice being performed. We jumped in a bit too late, when the first of the prisoners was killed. The sacrifice is to their god, Vulkoor. Apparently this place was Xen’Drik. We’re here!
