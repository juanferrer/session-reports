We had the dinner and talked a bit with everyone. They mentioned the Caebrek left, but no sign of them. We also notices some weird dyna-
“Adrik, you awake suddenly from a bad dream. You struggle to hold on to what it was about but are left with a sense of shame, something your 'dream self' felt they needed to hide from your friends.”
During the night, we were woken by the sound of broken glass. We went downstairs and Cordelia was in the library, apparently trying to get a book. But we think something else was happening.
As soon as Cordelia left, we heard her scream from the kitchen. We found Katryl’s headless corpse. Everyone except for Lacey showed up. We went to check her room and I found two weapons and my cursed ring of protection! O.O Is this what I wanted to hide?
Katryl room was empty, but Elora found a paper with some runes. Turns out it was dwarven, and it was my handwriting. It asked Katryl to meet me downstairs. But I don’t remember writing that note! Someone is trying to frame me…
Jonas locked Cornelia in a room where the floor turned liquid. We think he’s onto something.
After looking for him in every room, Elora called him and we heard whimpers from downstairs. A basement? We ran downstairs and found Jonas on the floor, looked for us in horror and asked us to stop this. Then, some tendrils come out from the obelisk behind him and enter into him, turning him into the bad guy (possessed).
We fought him and killed him. Still, a lot of unanswered questions…
