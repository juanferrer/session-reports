Adrik got possessed by the main ghost during the fight.
Venar Ruli: Human of average height. Long nose and short red hair.
"Demonstrations at Tower of Justice". Residents of Terminus are asking the government to protect them from Cirean criminals invading the city. They think our grizzly crime was action of some Cirean organisation.
We wait until dark to destroy the CPAD.
Toquill's intelligence contact is a man of average height that calls himself Bram.
At night, we went with the cart, donkey and rowboat to get rid of the CPAD. I failed many of my checks and the cart was going quite fast. Abel made the donkey fall asleep and the cart run it over. We had to levitate the thing all the way to the lake to destroy it.
After some shopping (got a black dire bear cloak), we went to captain Greenbottle's ship. They were making some customs check and the inspector was convinced he was smuggling goods inside statues. He broke one of the statues and found nothing inside it, leaving swiftly.
We shared a lovely evening with food, drinks and stories. He knows something about us, though.
