We got in and found some presentations from the 1-4 years and, when we tried to touch them, some statues behind animated and tried to kill us. We killed the first three, but tied the legs of the other 9. Then we fought them with a bit of an advantage as they fell over and tripped.

1st year:
- Wand of Spirit Guardians
- Wand of Hold Person
- Wand of Disguise Self

2nd year:
- Endless Goblet
- Ring of Protection
- Crystal Ball of Scrying

Dragonshards

4th year:
- Dust of Wind (x3)
- Beard Begone! (x3)
- “Arcane”

We met the funniest devil, Hasanas, in the Necromancy wizard’s office (Master of Undead Studies). He was summoned before the Mourning by some “goblin wizard” that told him he would help 4 strangers. He said the goblin wizard had a strange soul, like it was too old.
He mentioned “The Lady”, someone that controls the destiny of the souls?
This Hasanas mentioned the Watchers. Like they’re not human, although they look human. They seem animated, and their souls look like the souls of rats. Probably the mage-bred humans.

Found some scrolls in the Divination wizard’s office and the one after that.
We saw instructions on how to cast Cloud of Daggers in the classroom blackboard.

After a bit of wandering around the palace and seeing all sorts of abominations work of the Overseer, we got called by him. We saw him and he was a Beholder. 

A red-haired woman moved me out of the way of the Death Ray of the Beholder. She took my hand and said “A peace offering, come to the Crag. This comes at a cost of a great deal of magic”. I blinked away and only got partially hit. Then I had a card in my hand, the one she held.
