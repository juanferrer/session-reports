It was a hard fight. Four small brains, four of the tentacle guys and Elora's dad (as a brain). We managed to deal with the minions pretty quickly, but the brain was tough. He was trying to free Riman, and it did it, but Elora wished for Riman not to have been freed. We saw time going back to the moment before he was freed. That was freaky… As he was about to try, we managed to break open the casing protecting it and disconnected it from the machine it was plugged into. RIP tried to absorb the soul with Severance, but was unable to, as there was no soul to absorb. Very strange…
Zephyrath said that was very unusual for a creature of that type. He said the Outsiders are able to use powerful magic to re-shape reality. It´s possible they changed Himo (Elora's dad) into an elder brain. It's possible he's been returned to Xoriat. We might encounter him again.

Before leaving the room, RIP used sending to communicate with Elora's dad and received a message back about stopping the lies. He rambled on for a bit.

They arranged rooms for us. I went to the market with Abel. I found a Githzerai running the Something Gardens. She specialises in plants from different moons and was able to provide some info on the flora of Xoriat/Lharvion. She said I can't be sure if things are real or not. After inspecting the root she said these things were not there before the madness took over. She also mentioned the screaming was not real, I imagined it. We spent a while discussing these things.

We had dinner and went to bed for the night. Next day we decided we would go to Eberron for a few days and then travel to Xoriat to kill Xos and Vaster while they're still recovering.

We arrived at the Crab. Sora Teresa shared some news:

What machinations are hidden behind their seemingly innocuous façade? As investigators and those daring enough to uncover the truth peel back the layers of this shadowy cabal, we may find ourselves on the precipice of discovering the kingdom's most well-guarded secrets—or being consumed by them.*

> **VAMPIRIC WHISPERS: Did Karrnath's Undead Aristocracy Sire Queen Dannel into the Night?**
> *In the chilling northern realm, an outlandish theory emerges—a theory that suggests that Queen Dannel's disappearance is entwined with the age-old vampiric secrets of Karrnath, where the aristocracy thrives eternally on blood and darkness.*

As investigators and those who dare to confront the supernatural delve deeper into this outlandish theory, the kingdom teeters on the precipice of a horror that defies the boundaries of the living world.*

Seeing as Control has been taken to Wroat (at our request), we had to call her on SkyPhone.
She told us she doesn't remember anything that happened with her body while she was possessed. She mentioned being in a padded cell and being taken to treatment. Remembers other people, other prisoners and mind flayers as wardens. The staff was evil. Not hostile, but may become so. The minds of the inmates are fractured, so they may be hard to interact with. She mentioned one Lindra, that thought she needed to mourn everyone that has ever died. Another one collected butterflies that no one else could see.
