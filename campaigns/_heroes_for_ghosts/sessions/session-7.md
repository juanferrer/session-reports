In the chest there was 200 gold (which we split in half with the crew), 2 silver goblets (25 gold each), two rubies (50 gold each, split in half with the crew).

Elora and Abel did some drugs with the sending stone. They heard some language in their heads. The second attempt, Abel cast Comprehend Language and tried again.
"I do not understand outsider. Captives are taken. What is found in the sea is ours. The door they opened."

Siberys Dragon Shard (1000g) was the drug they took. It’s used for powering arcane devices (and snorting, apparently).
The Trolanport port police were looking for him for a while. 2000gp for his capture.
We can send a message to Captain Greenbottle through house Sivis.

Eberron Dragonshards can be found all around the Eberron. They are primarily refined into a powder to fuel almost any type of magic. Can be used in place of any component of an equivalent cost. Can be used in the creation of magical items.

Khyber Dragonshards are used in necromantic and binding rituals. They’re the most dangerous. They’re usually found around fiendish activity.

Siberys can be found all around Khorvaire. They are the rarest of the three types. They are mostly found on the continent of Xen’Drik, which draws explorers to the place. It’s used in the crafting of legendary items. This is the crystal they snorted.

117 - 123 Bridgeway Avenue is the address of Toquill’s colleague. He points us to Meina Rufferton, which proposed the theory (Asynchronous Collapse Theory) in which the CPAD is based. Delby is the carer of Toquill’s colleague.
Metrics Nackle was another assistant.

Kelben talks about working on a big important weapon. They’ve been working on for 4 years. It wouldn’t do so much as to destroy a country, so it doesn’t sound like the cause of the Mourning. Maybe a modified version of the device could.
Filigant Monoxal is the medicine he’s taking.

Someone put a note on my pocket.

Which is Dwarvish for:

> I don't know who you are, why you were talking to Kelben, or why the Trust if following you. But I guess that makes you the enemy of my enemy… Lose your tail and meat me at The Hare's Hair tavern.
> Please destroy this note before they can translate it.

The Trust seems to be a secret gnomish organisation.
We sneak out of the inn and try to go to the Hare’s Hair tavern. A woman with a pram was following us, so Able went to distract her. They left together. We got then to the tavern and met with the daughter of Kelben. They do keep him prisoner in his own house and in his own mind.
