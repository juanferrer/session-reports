House Jorasco hired house Deneth mercenaries to help them, so they may be in on it.
Humans, very skilled and well equipped. They are around Karnath, so they have some distance to cover.
So, we managed to get them. We prepared traps for the mercenaries and got attacked by a T-Rex at night! We killed it! Adrik got the last hit. Now weâ€™re waiting for the attack of the mercenaries.
