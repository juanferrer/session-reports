**Start Date**: 20th Lharviron (early evening)
 
Shortly before the party was due to bed down for the night Pan noticed lights in the distance.   Able argued in favour of investigating it and set off with Adrik.  They found an intact farmhouse.  Peering through the window they could see the lights on and human residents sitting down for supper.  Suspicious of Mournland tricks they decided to report back to Elora and RIP.  As soon as they were reunited however ghostly figures coalesced out of the mist.
 
Battle ensued between four Mourners, some deformed humans and a handful of willow wisps.  Adrik and Able made a break for the house while RIP feared several of the ghosts with his Turn Undead.  Pan just finished getting his scry camera out in time to catch Elora polymorph into t-rex and chomp down on the first of the ghosts.  Mournful wails from the ghostly figures terrified the party, tearing at their psyches.  Several of the Wisps converged on the gnome who, already badly injured from the wailing, dimensioned-doored into the house.  She just had time to heal up before another devastation wail nearly dropped her again.  Able resorted to stuffing ripped up table cloth in her ears!  One by one the enemies were slain with a mixture of Able's magic missiles, Adrik's Phase Axe, RIP's blight and a party record of 73 damage from Elorasaurus Rex!  (E-Rex?)
 
With the battle over the party reconvened at the house.  The inside was dark with the remains of last night's supper still fresh on the table but with the occupants dead in the bedroom.  Still from the outside, looking through the unbroken window, the lights were on and the residents were enjoying their dinner.   They chalked it up to Mournland weirdness and Able cast tiny hut so they could bed down for the night.  The night passed uneventfully apart from Elora having another of her dream-like visions why trancing; she saw her mother frozen in the centre of a storm, that when pulled back looked to be a giant baleful eye.
 
At dawn Elora suggested questioning the corpses and cast speak with dead.  They learned they had presumably died in the Mourning as the last thing they remembered seeing was a light in the west and then the approaching fog.
 
Continuing on the road after a few miles the fog came to a sudden end.  Stepping out of it they could see it stretched on north and south but they were on the inside of the bank that encircled and shrouded Cyre.   In front of them Mertol looked largely intact, though eerily silent.  Elora gave them a description of the main landmarks.  They decided her mother (and the queen) were probably in the Palace of Light (Royal), or Palace of Storms (Magic).  Taking the most direct route they were waylaid by a group of robed humanoids and a flying tiny eye construct at the flame gate.   The construct claimed to speak for someone called The Overseer.  It took exception to RIP saying the warforged in the city had become unruly and had been looting.  It insisted the queen was safe.  But their request to meet the Overseer was refused, as was entry to the Flamegate. They were asked to prove they were allies of Cyre by eliminating the Warforged problem.
 
As the party retreated to the northern route round the city RIP vowed vengeance on 'The Watchers' for their warforged racism.   The party decided to see what the warforged were up to before picking a side.  Adrik noticed RIP had returned to his normal height but was now smelling pleasantly of olives.  And Able noticed a small pea-sized blemish on his neck though could not discern anything more from it.  As they were examining RIP another warforged came out of a house a few hundred feet away, seeing the party crowned round the crouched down RIP, they took off running and the party gave chase.
 
After ducking between alleyways, and dives over rooftops the quarry was eventually grappled by Able of all people.  The tiny gnome managed to trip him with a stone-shape and cling to his ankle.   The forged, named Rust, was concerned the noise they'd made would attract Mourners.  He agreed to take them to their enclave at the station.  Mourners started to appear out of nearby houses and another chase ensued.  As they drew near to the station the forged guards let loose a barrage of artillery spells to drive back the pursuers.
 
Inside the sanctuary they were introduced to the local leader, Twenty-Two.  They granted temporary overnight refuge but said any longer would come at the cost of helping them.  Twenty-two asked if anyone was Orian Dragonmarked as they needed a driver for their Lightning Rail train.  They said they had a need for some items from the Kundarak vault in the Palace of Wind, some records from the Place of Earth and would welcome any effort to kill the Watchers or even better the Overseer.  The party remained uncommitted.  Twenty-Two explained the forged were in the city salvaging supplies for their leader the Sachem who was somewhere deeper in the Mournland.
