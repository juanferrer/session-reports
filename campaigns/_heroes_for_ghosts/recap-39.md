**Start Date**: 28th Lharviron (Late morning)
 
We picked up as RIP cast holy weapon on Adrik's phase axe, dropping concentration on banishment and allowing the vault monstrosity to return to the material plane.  The timed arcane charge went off.  Elora hit it with a lightning bolt and Adrik went in with a flurry of axe blows.  The poor creature never got a second attack.
 
But celebrations were too soon, for two floating brain-tentacle beasts descended on Abel.  She managed to get away but was pursued and grappled.  Within seconds the onslaught of tentacles and beaks had her unconscious.  The attacks did not stop and the creatures started to consume the gnome - killing her outright.  The rest of the group quickly rallied round, cut down the enemies and RIP, taking the 300 gold diamond from his pocket, revivified Abel.
 
The vault was searched and the sum total of wealth of Cyre, a meagre two and half thousand gold, was retrieved.  Adrik attempted to persuade them to donate it to the refugees, while Elora suggested as the one Cyrian in the group perhaps she should get it.  But RIP and Abel had already pocketed their share.
 
Plans were made to escape the palace and the party started cycling doors to search for rooms they had not yet been in.  Another Reforged (Three) was located, hiding in a room full of death records and the remains of Red and Smith were discovered and covered for later retrieval.   Among the last rooms a strange crystal growth was found and samples collected.  Adrik later used a piece of the crystal in the pommel of the sword he had been forging. 
 
The group made their way back outside and across the city with Abel and Elora riding the broom - taunting Mourners and leading them away from those traveling on foot.
 
While Locket and Three returned to the station the group paid a visit to the bank to try the new runes.  They were able to open the south east door to a frozen landscape in the middle of a blizzard.  Able bravely stepped in, looking for signs of moons from its surface.  She could make out a blue/green moon that looked unfamiliar.  She also found she could walk around the entrance, which was two dimensional and only visible from one side.  Adrik suggested that maybe the blue/green moon was no moon but perhaps Eberron viewed from a moon.  The group planted a flag made from a Mourning Glory T-Shirt to lay claim as the first people to travel there.
 
Back at the station final arrangements were made to leave the city.  RIP reattached the remaining train carriages.  Adrik finished off the smithing of the feather sword.  Elora did some reading and Able spent time identifying some of the magical items they had collected.
 
With a ten hour journey ahead of them, our party and most of the Reforged boarded the lightning rail and set off westwards - deep into the Mounland.   Just half an hour west they stopped off to investigate the Orien train yard and after an epic off camera fight with some crabs salvaged a replacement break car and a wand car.   The latter being a siege wand fitted on an open carriage.  The weapon was capable of firing a fireball at up-to 5th level but at the cost of Eberron dust.
 
As they continued onwards Elora noticed the tops of the Metralie mountains (south west of Metrol) looked like they had their tops shaved off.  Boulders scattered the landscape between them and the lightning rail tracks.   As the line turned southwards she could also see the south side of the mountains looked shiny.  Unable to discern it at a distance it became clear a few hours later as the polished surface stretched down to the once fertile plains of the Hara plateau.  The landscape here and up to the mountains had been turned to glass!  The party stopped the train to investigate.   Fine iridescent lines could be seen in the material,  all aligned north-south.  Abel recalled how extreme pressures and heat could cause this effect in crystal structures.  As the train neared Making it was noticed the north-south stress fractures rotated to an east-west alignment and the group considered this may point to the city being the origin of the Mourning event.
 
With the Making station destroyed the last part of their journey had to be made on foot.  Twenty Two led the way to an enormous crater, half a mile across and a hundred foot deep.   Across the crater an enormous Warforged could be seen, six scythes arching over his pauldrons and a six bladed double sword integrated into his right arm.  Presumable Sachem - aka the Lord of Blades.	Elora begged to borrow Adrik's shield to sled down as the rest of the group descended the rickety stairway.   Twenty Two asked them to wait while she spoke to Sachem.  She approached the hulking Warforged and Abel was able to lip read a couple of words "Sivis" and "Scrying".
 
Beckoned to approach him, he gave a speech to Pan's scry camera about wanting no trouble with the outside world, just to be left be by the breathers and by house Cannith, before signaling for the broadcast to be forcibly terminated via a magic missile.	Reacting to the hostile move they party draw their weapons.   Sashem tried to defuse and reassure them he had no ill intentions towards them.
 
The group asked him about his plans and the cult he had formed.  He denied it was a cult and claimed the name Sashem was not his but a title his people had given him.  While asking the party to follow him onto an airship that was being reconstructed with parts from Metrol, he spoke about his past. He had been in the Thranish army in the last war but like many forged suffered a loss of purpose and discrimination after emancipation.  He talked about a gnome artificer (Madam Duex Penn) who had taken him and other forged in.  She had given them a safe place to live and how they had helped in her work.  She had been attempting to build a craft capable of traveling to and across the astral sea.  Duex Penn had been killed when Real Lifers (anti-forged) stormed her chateaux.  Sachem claimed the fanatics had thought she was building a Creation Forge there.   Sachem had escaped with her plans and dozens of warforged, fleeing into the Mournland where the breathers would not follow.
 
The party cautiously inspected and explored the craft that had been constructed on the deck of the airship.  Sachem explained regular airships could not ascend indefinitely and would not be able to reach the Astral Sea.  The craft built from Duex Penn's designs made use of a sphere of annihilation to annihilate Siberys shards to propel it to the ring of Siberys and beyond.  Sachem announced his plan was to use the Vanguard to reach one of the moons and establish a teleportation circle through which his people could migrate.  Abel noticed the five seats inside and hearing about the voyage to the Astral Sea promised to do anything she could to help if she could have a seat on it.
