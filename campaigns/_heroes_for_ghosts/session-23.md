“Are you the followers of the Weavers?” ?!?!?
That’s what Medusa said.

After a fight in which Able got turned into stone and everyone else started to, we managed to slay Medusa and her stone beasts.

I found a small fly and a bag of beans. Suspicious bag though.

Sending response from Toquill:

“Camp freed. We found the reporter. Got ingredients for the potion. Able got petrified. Need new instructions”

RIP’s version: “Acid keeps 5 days. Per dose. Pipette 20 drops desiccator dry. Grind fine. Mix ethylic 2 cups. Alembic slowly. Dilute 1 to 50 exalted-aqua. Bottle.”

There was a bounty on Medusa’s head. She received her curse on a wish spell in Shadowmount Forest. She was visited by three hags. The curse will last until the followers of the Weavers seek the belly of the beast.

Chevron Ghallanda guided us to our rooms and is the grand niece of the lath we found in the settlement. She seems to have a personal interest in our stories and peculiar sites. She gave us a medallion that will give us free accommodation in any house Ghallanda.

She also suggested we visit her tailor and get shiftweave clothing. We are also getting ready for the hearing three days from now.

Yewin Fraplestamp is one of the prosecution lawyers and he’s in room 212. Toppip Migleleg is the other one, and he’s in room 213.
