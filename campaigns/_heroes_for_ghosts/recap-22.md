**Start Date**: 1st Lharvion (A little after Midnight)
 
Our heroes struggled with the creatures that had dropped on their heads and were attempting to suffocate them.   Elora and Adrik initially avoided them but it seemed no sooner one was removed they would fly up and reattach.  Adrik's sentinel and Elora's new crossbow proved invaluable with pinning them down.   Meanwhile a roper that had been lurking in the dark cave pool made several attempts to grapple and reel in the party.  Able was soon unconscious and in the water.  Adrik leapt onto the creature as RIP brought out his spirit guardians, obliterating most of the face-huggers.  RIP stabilised Able and Elora brought her back to consciousness so she should re-enter the fight.  The gnome misty stepped out of the creatures tendrils and let loose some trusty magic missiles before the roper was finally slain as RIPs spirit guardians ate it from the inside out.  The one remaining face-hugger was trying to hide on the cave roof but spotted with an excellent search by Elora who promptly shot it with one of her needle bolts.
 
Before leaving the cave RIP investigated a flooded passageway beneath the roper pool and noted there was light at the end.  Licking their wounds the party headed back out to the abandoned camp for a rest and some healing.  Once again Elora found it impossible to rest without doing some needlework first.  Adrik considered this new found interest of Elora's only started after she got her new crossbow and put forth the theory that maybe the bolts were cursed.  They all agreed it was more healthy than some of her other interests.
 
Back in the cave Able and Adrik inspected the purple crystals.  Able struggled to remember what they were but fortunately Adrik identified them as Buxus Crystals (used in healing potions).  They managed to prise one lose while Elora scouted the other passage and located the Basilisk.
 
Rushing into the basilisk's lair the party got the jump of the creature.   Elora hit it hard with a lightning bolt but was unable to resist looking at the beast and began to petrify.  Able cast sleep and weakened by the lighting it was enough to knock it out.  With just seconds to spare before it would wake they quickly discussed a plan… Adrik rushed up to it with his Phase Axe in hand and RIP cast Blindness on it.   Unable to see any of the party and use its petrifying gaze the outcome was now inevitable and the beast was quickly dispatched.   Adrik set about extracting its stomach while RIP went for his favourite organs… its eyes.
 
As the rest were starting to harvest body parts Able's attention was drawn to a somewhat out of place water font or pool at the back of the room.  She had gotten close to it when a medusa emerged  - hissing about them slaying her pet.   Quickly Adrik finished cutting free the basilisk stomach and RIP retrieved the eyes.  Elora asked the medusa "What do people do at a party with a medusa?  They get stoned".  Against all odds she found this hilarious and was incapacitated with laughter.  They fled the room with the stomach and headed for the camp.
 
Unwilling to attempt the broken bridge they made an attempt to cut some wood to span it, but with some strange stone like zombies emerging from the cave they did not have enough time.  Adrik had the idea the underwater passage RIP had found might lead to the waterfall so the party all dove into the pool on a chance.  Fortunately he was correct and they emerged in a hidden lack above the falls.  Able made her first use of 'Rope Trick' to ease the difficult descent down the falls.  Back at camp they relaxed with some beers from Pan's bag of colding and discussed what to do next.  They elected to rest and go back in the morning to investigate the medusa's pool and get more of the purple crystals.
 
Refreshed they headed back up the mountain, this time with Pan in tow.  He had told them he'd had a sending and his bosses at Scry News were very happy with his Jorasco story. The party was famous as it had become the biggest news story in Khorvaire; though people were having to speculate who the mysterious adventurers were.   It was agreed he could join the medusa hunt so long as he avoided filming their faces.  Elora gave him some advice on getting some dramatic establishing shots.
 
Inside the cave the party decided to prioritise mining some of the Buxus Crystals.  A process that was quickly interrupted as a horrifying three-legged beast emerged from the floor.  Pan eagerly filmed and narrated the encounter.  The fight was brought to an impressive end when Adrik threw his Phase Axe, hitting it with a critical and recalling it back to his hand as he turned and smiled for the camera!  Bob (Able) struggled to identify the creature but decided to describe it as "Purple Teethy Gnasher" to an ecstatic Panadon.
 
We left as the party rushed into the former lair of the basilisk to confront the medusa.
