**Start Date**: 19th Nymm (early evening)
 
Making camp a safe distance from the recently raided quetzal nest the party bedded down for a much needed rest. Elora again experienced a dream while trancing, her sister, this time under a starless sky and sensing someone behind her turned to see her mother.
 
Setting out on the penultimate day of travel Able took the lead on scouting and taking the opportunity to look out for more dinosaurs for her book; seeing a dimetrodon and a group of brontosaurus. Elora and Sas sneaked up to take a closer look. Sas stepped on a tiny kuttaraptor nearly causing the brontos to charge before Elora was able to extract the two of them.
 
Nearing their final nights camp Able noticed some quetzals in the distance and the group considered they might be following them after stealing their eggs… or perhaps attracted by the lingering eggy smell coming from Adrik. A cave was located nearby but found to be occupied by an ankylosaurus. Elora argued for killing the beast but Adrik and Able opted for scaring it off. A suggestion was made to drug the dino but the elf was not keen on sharing her stash! Instead Adrik tossed a rock at it and illusionary magic was used to chase it off.
 
RIP raised concerns about the anky coming back in the night and so alarms and watches were set before the party lay down for the night. Once more troublesome dreams invaded Elora's trance; again she saw her sister waving across the blue landscape and sensing someone behind her. However this time when she turned she found the disfigured face of the witch Mahari, lower jaw missing and tongue lolling out of what remained of her mouth. 
 
The anky did return but was again chased off and was snatched up by one of the hunting quetzals.
 
The next day, after a few hours travel, the party found themselves at the outskirts of the Lost Flats and could see off in the distance a settlement surrounded by fields - presumably the Dakshin Homestead site they had been seeking. Carefully approaching they spotted a humanoid body being consumed by a pack of raptors… Acting quickly to perhaps save the individual Albe and Adrik dashed in, joined by RIP at a tactical distance, but overtaken by the faster Elora who presented a delicious fresh target for the raptors! The elf fell to the teeth and claws of the dinos before they were cut down with magic missiles, sacred flames and Adrik's axe.
 
Elora was revived and the group set about examining the body the raptors had been eating. RIP determined it was a human male and due to the lack of blood spray they had been dead before the raptors got to them. The party decided to take the corpse back to the camp Sas was setting up before heading into the township. On the outskirts of town the group was intercepted by a couple of halfling Jorasco guards who failed to conceal their surprise when told about the corpse. One went to retrieve the body from Sas while the other escorted them into town so Elora's wounds could be treated.
 
Inside the Jorasco clinic they met Dr Calla de'Jorasco (giving her a number of fake names). The doctor welcomed them into town and quizzed them about how they came to be there and acknowledged Elora's sister was a resident. While Elora was taken to see her sister RIP offered to help with the examination of the corpse. When the Jorasco doctor tried to pass off the death as a snake bite RIP offered to check for poisons. Casting detect Poison and Disease he noted to himself that the man had died of an unknown poison but also had Tenebris-Accipit (Tar Beast) in his system! Before the spell faded he looked around and also detected a quantity of that substance in the next room along with more tar beast!
 
Elora had an emotional reunion with her sister. In her newly built but basic cabin Meriele appeared to be quite happy, talking about the good work they were doing growing ingredients for cheap healing potions. But Elora sensed something was off… Joined by the rest of the party Meriele talked excitedly about how they should all join the community. She was distraught to hear of the death of Pomeroy - but explained it away as one of the dangers of leaving the safety of the township. She described how The House had a device they kept the dinosaurs away from the town. 
 
Informing them she needed to start her 20 hour shift! She explained that because of the wonderful food they were fed she hardly needed more than an hour's trance a day and spent the rest of the time working. Meriele left them to rest in her cabin and Doctor Calla returned to let them know Mr. Copperkettle was preparing them dinner. RIP told the party about the Tar Beast and they decided they needed to not "drink the kool aid".
 
The community dining room was attached to the large building in the centre of town. The building also seemed to be a workshop for the processing of Crying Brittlebrush into Luminous Buxus (a component in healing potions). Once seated the party met the flamboyant warforged chef, Mr. Copperkettle. A delicious meal of spiced beef was served along with a tall glass of charmeur lambert (some kind of smoothie). RIP explained he needed to pray over the meal and cast Purify Food and Drink to remove the suspected Tar Beast additive. He was successful in doing so but the spell did not nullify the other property of the smoothie. All but Adrik fought off the wisdom save as Mr. Copperkettle tried to charm the party into joining the cult-like community.
 
With Adrik now a true believer and Able, Elora and RIP pretending to be, they were allowed a four hour rest before taking up their new roles as workers for Jorasco. RIP did not need to sleep and four hours was enough for Elora's trance, but Able and Adrik had to battle through the lack of a long rest… as they scrambled to form a plan.
 
All too soon the knock came and Elora and Adrik were taken out to weed the fields. Able was sent to alchemical processing and RIP sent to medical.
 
We finished off with RIP, who had been sent to bury Pomeroy, taking his flask of black powder and setting a trail of it to the wooden wall of the clinic. From the fields Elora and Adrik saw the flash of a fireball as the warforged set light to it…
