After fighting a few monsters, we found a book that could store and steal knowledge off of other books. Very interesting. The underkeeper was killed, but RIP cast Gentle Repose on him, so maybe he gets revived.

Able found out about different ways to get to the Astral Sea, but the most interesting point was that time passes slower there. There’s stories about hunters that followed prey through an enchanted forest and disappeared for years, while they thought it only took a few hours.

Elora wanted to know about petrification. Physical damage to petrified humanoids is retained after being reverted. They’re not alive nor dead. True resurrection doesn’t work on a ground up and scattered petrified creature. There must be a natural creature that petrified the royal family of Cyre. Beholders, Medusas and Basilisks can cause petrification, so probably one of them is present in Cyre. Or maybe someone cast True Polymorph to turn someone into a creature with that ability.
Greater Restoration can revert someone back to flesh. Also, basilisk oil can work. No time limit.

Elora also made some enquiries about some bard artifacts, mainly stories, but there’s no location of history about these items. Anyways, most of them seem to be not in Khorvaire.

Modern history about the Daughters: Hayle Longtooth, “Deliverance in Droaam”. Three powerful casters that got together in 986 YK (11 years ago). The Daughters unified the land of Droaam and seem to be controlling it. They are capable of shifting their appearance, although they tend to prefer a type.

- Sora Katra is a charismatic, beautiful, seductive woman. She’s the leader of the group, probably. She appears as a 20-30 year old dressed very provocatively. She takes many lovers of many species and genders.
- Sora Maenya is a hulking creature. She’s the muscle of the group. 8 ft tall. She once crushed a minotaur’s skull with her bare hands.
- Sora Teraza is an ancient woman of coal-like eyes. She’s probably the best seer and diviner in Eberron. Her visions guide the strategies and actions of the coven. The writer seems to be going crazy and says Teressa visited in his dreams.

Three of them together are much stronger than separate. They have recruited other covens to their aquelarre. These are probably the sisters we fought. They live in the Great Crag.

Less information was found about the Outsiders. Most knowledge in the library is about humans, so no first hand accounts are. “The Folly of the primitive goblinoid tribes”, author. There seems to be a war between orcs and outsiders. He thinks the outsiders were just primitive humans with advanced technology. Sailing ships, the author guesses. Powerful psionic abilities? He doesn’t think the goblinoids were much of a threat to the outsiders, which are probably just humans. One book had drawings copied from an old orcish manuscript. The drawings look like the Ziggurat. There were 13 pictograms carved into the ziggurat, which curiously matches the moons of Eberron.

Elora and Able did some drugs, but asked for Adrik’s help to grind it. At the end of the night we decided to draw from the deck. A frost giant, a kobold, a goblin and an orc appeared.
