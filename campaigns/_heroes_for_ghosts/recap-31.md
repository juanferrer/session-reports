**Start Date**: 24th Lharviron (Morning)
 
Elora cracked open the newly installed window and had a quick look around before climbing into the foyer of the Palace of Storms, followed by the rest of the party.
 
Seeing a number of display cases containing magic items Adrik immediately tried to open on and triggered a trap that activated three animated armours. Not overly threatened by the automated defences the party quickly dispatched them. They briefly considered looting the rest of the displays later but opted to grab it all now! They bound together the legs of the remaining armours, chaining them together before triggering each group. Elora kited the hapless constructs and one by one they fell. The party scooped up the wands, enchanted items, dragon shards, and powders (all yet to be identified).
 
As they pondered if anyone had heard the clanging of weapons on armour and repeated casting of toll the dead a muffled voice was heard coming from the Masters Studies. Peering into Master Trothhut MaD MUS BAR (Necromancy) chambers they found a horned humanoid who introduced himself as Hasanas (a devil). Hasanas was trapped in a magic circle where he had apparently been summoned some three years prior by Shaman Dha'iteag. The group learned Dha'iteag was apparently a goblin and he had summoned the devil just before the Mourning - telling him "some friend would be along later and might need your help". In exchange for his freedom Hasanas offered to inspire the party and to provide on request one piece of aid that was within his power. Dubious of his intentions the party was hesitant to help him. When he provided a contract to make it official with an added optional clause offering a squad of devils in exchange for the subject's soul, even more suspicion was cast on him. Eventually Abel decided to sign it after learning Hasanas could get a message to her brother. Abel assured the party she had no intention of invoking the second pact and forfeiting her soul.
 
Hasanas also mentioned a few things about soulsâ€¦ The magebreed humans seemed to have rat souls. Shaman Dha'iteag had a soul that was too old for a goblin. And he'd lost hundreds of souls contracted to him since his incarceration in the circle because he'd failed to collect them before they dissolved in Dolurrh - apparently most souls fade away there after thirteen days. 
 
Moving on, several spell scrolls were found in the next couple of studies (Master Maartel MaD MDI BAR (Divination) and Master Imaradi MaD MC BAR (Conjuration)). Along with a balloon spider trapped in some stasis field. Abel decided the small (50g) Syberis shard was worth releasing the creature.
 
The next room contained some student workstations and instructions for the Cloud of Daggers spell. Adrik desperately wanted to learn the spell though it was somewhat outside his area of magical expertise. Abel explained she had a copy of the spell that she had no intention of learning and he could try and learn that if he wished. 
 
Continuing to the north end of the tower a point-to-point elevator circle was discovered and assumed to lead to the upper level. Two doors lead to an alchemy lab and the forge. The alchemy lab contained a couple of brightly coloured skunks that had been eating the ingredients. They didn't seem hostile but would spray anyone attempting to take their food. Adrik briefly suffered the effect of the reduce spell before Abel maged-handed a portion of flight out of the room. The forge was an altogether less jolly affair; a horribly mutilated warforged was present - it appeared to be the conjoined remains of at least three warforged. After it became hostile when the party entered RIP banished it, giving the party time to inspect the room. Abel disabled the modification forge to prevent further similar atrocities and the group withdrew - hoping to let 22 know about the sorry creature and see if they could help it.
 
Deciding to fully explore the ground floor the party left a tin suspended as an alarm and made their way to a room labelled 'reading rooms', though it quickly became apparent it was the area used for the magebreed human experiments. Several unmatured creatures were present in tanks. The party decided to destroy the equipment and put-down the creatures.	Shortly after the fighting finished the tinkle of the alarm tin was heard and one of the Watchers was seen coming down the corridor with the Overseer's Homunculi. 
 
The Homunculi seemed to know the party was in the room and summoned them to the central theatre. The party followed the speechless Watcher after trapping the Homunculi in a robe. There among the rowed tiered seating the Overseer addressed the party, demanding to know what they were doing in his tower. The conversation did not go well and Elora took off for the elevator with the rest of the party following.
 
Teleported to the upper level the party marched into the archmage's chambers unchallenged. Across the open centre of the tower the Queen and her guards could be seen, petrified as expected. Off to the left a strange device with a constellation of orbiting points of light could be seen. Almost as soon as Pan had caught sight of that with his Scry Camera, Able received a sending direct from Lyssee d'Sivis saying "That device is important! Get it!"
 
The Overseer finally revealed himself as the 6ft blue-bodied , eye-staked aberration of a beholder. Adrik tried one last time to reason with him before spells started to be thrown and eye-rays fired. Things were looking very bleak for Adrik as the beholders deathray lanced towards him for a lethal 82 damage he realised he was about to die. As time seemed to stop for the dwarf he noticed a woman stood next to him. Beautiful, red-haired and dressed in green silks, she spoke to him "This comes at the cost of a great deal of magic - a peace offering - come to the crag." She moved him to the side so the deathray glanced him for half damage and left a card in his hand as time restarted.
 
Elora attempted to polymorph the beholder sadly failed but then RIP followed up with a successful blindness disabling his attacks for at least one round.
