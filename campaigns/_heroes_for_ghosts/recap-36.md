**Start Date**: 26th Lharviron (Nearly Midnight)

Twenty Two reiterated the need to try and find information on House Cannith land holdings from the Palace of Earth, and to rescue or recover the party of Reforged previously sent there.  The party took the obviously logical step of transforming RIP into a T-Rex! And rode the polymorphed warforged across the city to reach the former administrative centre for Cyre!  Having picked up a healthy following of Mourners along the way they barred the main doors and began to explore.

Moving east into Permits and Records they found a number of hollowed out corpses.  Elora was quick to try and search them and was quickly engulfed as they animated!   RIP-Rex took the skin-suited Elora in his mouth and shook the elf free as the rest of the party set about the enemies with axes and spells.

When a search of the room turned up nothing they moved north into a corridor and faced a floating energy creature.  It looked similar but more benign than the ones that attacked the lighting rail.  After some experimentation it was discovered the entity seemed to be attracted to noise (though Adrik was a little slow to catch on).   Eventually the party got it to move far down the corridor and proceeded with their exploration.

The next door opened lead to the vault but it also contained an enormous undead monstrosity and so the door was quietly closed again.  The party prepared themselves for battle and opened the door once more only to find it leading into a different room.  Abel tried the door they had entered from and by pure chance got the same room - but a few openings and closing later they established the doors seemed to link randomly to rooms when opened.  Care was taken to keep doors open from then on…  Another room full of undead was located.  During the fight Elora had her mind invaded and intellect lowered to a window licking six.  A red key rune was recovered and the party rested up while the elf recovered her faculties and everyone bandaged their wounds.

Their door connection brought them back to the previous hallway and the next room turned out to be the council chamber.  Occupying the centre of the large room was a swirling black vortex.  Suspicious of it the party decided to try tossing bits of broken furniture but could not get the range.  Once again Elora threw caution to the wind and edged closer to throw in a chair leg… the vortex intensified and pulled the elf into the centre crushing her in its gravity sinkhole.  As she dragged herself back to the party the vortex followed - zapping at the party with energy discharges.   With the vortex moved from the centre of the room a hole was uncovered and Abel went to investigate.  As they moved closer to the northern end the undead councillors entered the fight.  The vortex was destroyed and a turn undead CC'd the councillors.  One broke free and managed to get off a Hunger of Hadar spell which focused the party's attention on the danger they posed.   As the rest of the councillors tried to flee RIP-Rex shooed them back to the party (like chickens) and they were finally cut down with a flourish from Adrik's phase axe.

Patting themselves on their backs for deadly encounters swiftly defeated, they moved on to inspect the hole in the floor.  Adrik dropped down his rope of climbing and descended.  At the bottom he found himself in a similar ancient alien ruin to the one in Grosk and face to face with a Weeping Angel…  He blinked!  RIP had already started his descent when the dwarf's screams alerted the rest of the party.  Abel misty stepped down.  Elora slid down the rope - knocking RIP to the bottom.  Abel cast stoneshape from her bracers, shattering one of the angels for a record-breaking 74 damage. But our gnome also became confused and tried to hit Adrik with her quarterstaff.  RIP tried casting blindness to little effect but also found himself uncontrollably casting fog cloud.  With everyone's view obscured the Angels closed in!  Adrik made use of warding wind to clear the fog around them but it was too late.  Several of the Angels slashed out and hit RIP and Elora - Petrifying them!
