We got in Dunroy’s dairy farm and he wanted to make us leave. We got into a fight when I said we would call the authorities after he attempted to make us leave when we found a dead body.
He escaped leaving a human skin bag with magical properties. We don’t know what it’s for.
On his desk we find:
A piece of paper with an address. Our address! (Vqswknn? 11 Hastehamton Way, Platinate)
A note with a codified message or an unknown language
The note was in a modification of Caesar’s Cipher (-2):
Dear Salmon,

Toquill's guards prevented us from acquiring the device. It is more important than ever we recover the cache. I will join you in Groshk shortly. Perhaps I can persuade the prisoner to divulge the location. I do not want to have to resort to salvaging in the Mournland.

Your sister in arms,

> Coteh
> The note was being written by Dunroy. He may be Coteh. Or maybe they’re shapeshifters and they took their shape. It mentions a Groshk, a city in Darguun (between Marguul Pass and The Seven Caves
> Toquill suggest we go and find if there are any other CPADs. We should go to Trolanport, Zilargo to find the original engineer and ask them. He also wants us to get an animal and cart to transport the parts of the CPAD, probably to destroy them. We will also get new guards in Sword and Staffing. Finally, we will help him dispose of the device.

We found these boars to take us:

- Bernard Castle: Captain Greenbottle (free for security service, 6 days, leaves in 3 days).
- Grenado: Captain Grayson (free for work, 8 days, leaves in 4 days).
- Pombar: Captain Olbretty (36GP/person, 12 days, leaves in 2 days).

600: Total
Mule: 10 (8 back)
Cart: 15 (13 back)
Passage: Free!
Row boat: 17 GP

The woman at the head of Sword and Staffing has disappeared, so we can’t get more guards for Toquill. We’ll sort this before we leave.

Jarron and Halnor are the wizard (female half-elf, fancy white cloak) and fighter (human male, green stuff) that went to look for her.

We got to the woman’s house and we found trails of blood leading to the corpses of Jarron and Halnor. They had some magical items on them

- White Cloak with patches: Robe of useful items
- Horn: Horn of Silent Alarm (4 charges, 1d4 charges daily at dawn)
- Scale Mail: Castoff Scale Mail (Equip or unequip as an action)
- Wizard Spellbook: Sleep, Rope Trick, Magic Missile, (...)

We had to fight an invisible apparition. After we saw behind the final door there was a skinned corpse in some sort of ritual. Just before the end of the session, two more apparitions showed up.
