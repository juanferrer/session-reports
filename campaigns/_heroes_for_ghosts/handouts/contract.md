**Covenant of Ownership**: The Client acknowledges and agrees that, upon the transfer of her immortal soul to the Contractor, said soul shall become the exclusive property of the Contractor, to be held, used, and disposed of at the Contractor's discretion, for eternity.

**Conditions of Termination**: Notwithstanding the perpetual nature of the title and power of Queen of Cyre, the Contractor reserves the right to terminate this Contract and revoke the Client's title and power under the following conditions:

</ol>

**Governing Law**: This Contract shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Daanvi, without regard to conflict of law principles.

**Severability**: If any provision of this Contract is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.
