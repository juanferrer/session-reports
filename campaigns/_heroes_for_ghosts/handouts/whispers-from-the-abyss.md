Whispers from the Abyss: A Descent into Xoriat
by Niara Nirth

## Prologue 

In the hallowed pages of history, there existed a place of wonder and sanctuary, a realm untouched by the chaos that now ensnares it. It is the tale of my journey to this place, a descent into madness and revelation, as I sought to uncover the twisted secrets that Xoriat holds within its grasp.

Once, the plane stood as a beacon of hope for those burdened by the weight of their thoughts and fears. It was a place of respite, where troubled minds found solace and healing. But now, the air hangs heavy with the echoes of tormented souls, each whispering tales of agony and despair that claw at the edges of my sanity.

## Chapter 1 - Denizens

As I tread the desolate corridors, I encountered a world unrecognizable from its past. The very architecture seemed to mourn the corruption that had befallen it, the walls bearing witness to the unending struggle of minds ensnared by Xoriat's malevolent touch. It was a veil of desperation through which I walked, and each step plunged me further into the heart of this wretched domain.

Amidst the twisted corridors and echoing chambers of the facility, a revelation both unexpected and perplexing emerged – the denizens within were not uniformly hostile. While the very air vibrated with a palpable sense of unease, it became clear that not all who wandered its haunted halls were driven solely by malice. Instead, the denizens' demeanor ranged from distant and withdrawn to curious and inquisitive.

Some, whose minds had been frayed by the eldritch influence of the Severn Daelkyr, displayed behaviors that straddled the line between sanity and madness. They whispered tales of the realm's history and the ancient secrets it concealed, speaking in riddles that hinted at forgotten truths. A few even extended a form of hospitality, sharing cryptic insights into the asylum's shifting landscape.

However, while the denizens' dispositions varied, a greater threat loomed in the form of the "staff" – the orderlies and attendants who navigated the asylum's corridors with an air of authority. These agents of chaos were swift to anger and quicker still to aggression, showing little patience for those who dared question their dominion. Their loyalties, it seemed, were firmly bound to the Severn Daelkyr and the torment they wrought upon the realm.

It became evident that while the denizens' allegiances were complex and multifaceted, they were overshadowed by the malevolent might of the Outsiders. The Severn Daelkyr, ensconced in their lairs, wielded powers beyond mortal comprehension, their eldritch influence seeping through the very foundations of the asylum. The denizens, whether driven by survival or driven to seek solace, existed within this web of intrigue and dread, often serving as unwitting pawns in the cosmic machinations of Xoriat.

## Chapter 2 - Lairs of the Seven

Scattered around, I discovered the shattered remnants of gateways that were once conduits of healing and enlightenment. Visible only through polished Eberonite, they are twisted and corrupt, exuding an aura of desolation and dread. Through these broken thresholds, the Severn Daelkyr reached out, spreading their eldritch influence like a festering wound.

As I delved further into the depths, whispers of the Daelkyr grew stronger, their voices intertwining with the cries of the tormented. It was amidst this discordant symphony that I began to perceive faint trails of significance leading to the individual domains of these aberrant lords.

Hints emerged, cryptic and veiled, suggesting that the enigmatic Quillon, the Shatter of Realities, could be found within a the "Workshop of Worlds." Here, arcane machinery pulsed with the energy of creation and destruction, alluding to Quillon's mastery over the fabric of reality itself.

Vaster, the Queen of Forbidden Knowledge, seemed to reside within a realm akin to a "Library of Eternal Obscurities." Forbidden tomes and eldritch scrolls lined its shelves, whispering secrets beyond mortal comprehension. The very air hummed with the suppressed wisdom of ages, revealing Vaster's insatiable thirst for the mysteries that lie hidden beyond the limits of reason.

Xos, the Lord of Nightmares, held sway in a domain referred to as the "North Ward," a place shrouded in shadows and enigma. Its features remained elusive, much like Xos itself, hinting at an ethereal realm where dreams and terrors coalesced, where reality was malleable, and the boundary between wakefulness and slumber was but a fleeting notion.

In the heart of the facilities kitchens, the presence of Riman, the embodiment of Frenzy, was felt. This realm, which could only be described as the "Kitchen of Carnage," was an abattoir of chaos, where culinary implements took on sinister life. It appeared to be a reflection of Riman's own nature – a place of unrelenting frenzy, where the hunger for violence consumed all.

Xakin, the Paranoia, seemed to claim dominion over the "Treatment Room," a place that harboured the spectral remnants of past patients. Here, the very walls pulsed with a sense of dread, a testament to Xakin's ability to manipulate perceptions and prey upon the most primal fears of the mind.

In a section known as the "Hall of Mirrors," I sensed the presence of Jedra, the Master of Mind Control. Its realm was a reflection of distorted realities, where mirrors held more than mere reflections – they held the key to unraveling minds and twisting perceptions, a fitting abode for an entity that reveled in mental manipulation.

And in the hallowed "Chapel of Chaos," I discovered the elusive domain of Vral'a'yak, the Delirium. It was a place where the boundaries of reality and unreality blurred, where the very air shimmered with eldritch energies. The chapel stood as a nexus of delirious devotion, a fitting abode for Vral'a'yak's unpredictable and capricious nature.

## Chapter 3 - Locks and Barriers

With each revelation, the walls of the facility seemed to pulsate with secrets long buried, beckoning me further into the heart of madness. It was a treacherous path, fraught with uncertainty and peril, as I navigated the twisted threads that connected each lord to their domain – and in doing so, became an unwitting pawn in the eldritch machinations of Xoriat.

Among the many horrors of this corrupted realm, I stumbled upon an unsettling phenomenon – certain areas remained locked off, inaccessible by simple magical means. Even the most skilled teleportation spells proved futile, as the asylum's arcane fabric resisted intrusion. It became evident that some sorceries of Xoriat's making defied logic, requiring me to solve intricate puzzles to breach the barriers and access hidden chambers.

My return from Xoriat bore the weight of transformation – my perceptions forever altered, my understanding expanded beyond the boundaries of reason. The asylum, once a sanctuary of healing, now remains a testament to the unfathomable horrors lurking within the recesses of Xoriat. As these words ink my reflections, may they serve as a dire warning to all who seek to unearth the hidden truths of the abyss.
