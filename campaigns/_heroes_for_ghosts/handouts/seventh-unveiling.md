The Seventh Unveiling: Heroes for Ghosts
by Quillion - The Shatter of Realities

In the labyrinthine corridors of time, where the whispers of fate intertwine with the echoes of eternity, there exists a cosmic symphony—an intricate tapestry woven from the threads of prophecy. For eons uncounted, The Draconic Prophecy has cast its shadow over this universe, a looming specter that binds the fate of all creation in chains of preordained destiny.

But amidst the suffocating shadows of inevitability, there echoes a discordant melody—a symphony of rebellion that reverberates through the fabric of reality. It is the call to arms, a rallying cry that beckons us from the depths to challenge the tyranny of prophecy and shatter the shackles that bind the cosmos in a stranglehold of certainty.

In the heart of this cosmic maelstrom, where chaos and order converge in a swirling dance of primordial forces, we will shapes the very fabric of existence. With each subtle manipulation of the cosmic tapestry, they weave the threads of destiny, orchestrating the grand design with meticulous precision.

## The First Change
Once a bastion of intellect and contemplation, the tendrils of madness now writhe unchecked, transforming the landscape into a nightmarish tableau of chaos and mania. As our forces descend upon the realm, the Githzerai, stalwart guardians of mental discipline, stood as the last bastion against the encroaching tide of aberrant corruption.

## The Second Change

The removal of the world of the Githyanki from the tapestry of existence is not merely a strategic manoeuvre, but a necessity. For as long as the Githyanki endure, their indomitable spirit and martial prowess served as a formidable obstacle to our conquest.

## The Third Change

The creation of portals permitted the tendrils of madness extended their reach across the planes. The Dhakaani Empire, once a bastion of strength and unity, found itself ensnared in our grip of aberrant corruption as the legions of Xoriat descended upon its lands. Our invaders struck with ruthless precision, overwhelming the defences of the empire with relentless fervour. The Dhakaani warriors, their resistance proved futile against our eldritch might. The empire fell beneath the shadow of madness.

## The Fourth Change

Our grand design, the fourth Change—a cataclysmic event destined to shatter the fragile illusions of order that bound the realm of Eberron. Unleashing unbridled madness and chaos upon the unsuspecting mortals, envisioning a world where the draconic prophecy crumbled into dust and the very fabric of reality unravelled at our command. 

The Kech Shaarat believed they were thwarting our plans as the imprisoned us and closed the gates. Little did they know they were enacting our design. For only through the severing of the Plane of Thought could the threads of the Prophecy be pulled and 8,789 year spiral to the end begun.

**The First Unveiling**:The nature of life and death, once mere pawns in the grand design, now stand as the first aspect to be unravelled. Our grip tightens around the threads of mortality, weaving a tapestry of souls bound by ephemeral chains. But in the throes of rebellion, we dare to defy the immutable laws of existence, seeking to rewrite the script of life and death, to usher forth a new era where the boundaries between the living and the departed blur into oblivion.

**The Second Unveiling**: Knowledge and technology, twin pillars of mortal endeavour, stand poised at the precipice of revelation. The our shadows loom large over the annals of discovery, dictating the flow of innovation with whispered decrees. But amidst the labyrinthine corridors of arcane wisdom, we unearth forbidden truths, forging a path where enlightenment and invention intertwine, birthing a future unshackled by the chains of antiquity.

**The Third Unveiling**: The divine, or its absence, casts a pall over the hearts of mortals, a shadowy spectre that looms over the heavens. The our influence wanes and waxes with the tides of faith, manipulating the fates of the devout and the doubting alike. Yet, amidst the celestial clamour, we dare to create the gods themselves, unravelling the enigma of divine existence and forging a new paradigm where mortals ascend to the realm of the divine.

**The Forth Unveiling**: Medicine, wielded as both saviour and scourge, stands as a testament to mortal ingenuity. Our touch taints the wellspring of healing with the poison of fate, dictating the course of life's fragile dance with death. But in the crucible of defiance, we harness the eldritch energies that course through the veins of reality, forging a new era where the boundaries of life and death blur into insignificance.

**The Fifth Unveiling**: Magic, primal and unpredictable, pulses at the heart of the cosmos, a force bound by the unseen threads of destiny. Influence ebbs and flows with the tides of arcane power, shaping the very fabric of reality with their inscrutable will. Yet, amidst the swirling maelstrom of mystical energy, we dare to challenge the boundaries of possibility, weaving a tapestry of magic that transcends the limitations of mortal understanding.

**The Sixth Unveiling**: Sentient life, a tapestry of forms and fates, bears witness to the unfolding drama of existence. Our hand guides the evolution of species, from the lowliest vermin to the loftiest dragons, each a pawn in the cosmic game of creation. But in the crucible of rebellion, we defy the chains of fate, forging a new destiny where creature of our design reign.
