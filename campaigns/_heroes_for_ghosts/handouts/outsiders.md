## The Dual Existence Conjecture

In the culmination of our extensive exploration into the realm of the Outsiders, a daring theory emerges that challenges the boundaries of reality and unreality. It is postulated that these eldritch entities, in their splintered existence, straddle two worlds simultaneously – our own and the twisted dominion of Xoriat. Should an Outsider be vanquished within our realm, their essence remains tethered to their lair on Xoriat, awaiting regeneration before they can project their influence once more.

Conversely, should they be held captive outside Xoriat's grasp, their capacity to shape our reality becomes severely constrained, casting doubts upon their omnipotence. This theory, though tantalizing, raises questions about the Outsiders' inherent duality, presenting a complex puzzle that extends beyond the boundaries of our understanding. It is suggested that during their regeneration within their lairs, these entities may be diminished in their power, and the revelations unveiled within this tome could serve as a foundation for further exploration into the profound intricacies that underlie the existence of the Outsiders

## Conclusion

As we conclude this study, let us reflect on the revelations uncovered about these Outsiders and their minions. Each of these beings embodies a facet of existence rarely comprehended by mortals. May this compendium guide you through the mysteries of the Outsiders and inspire further exploration into the depths of their lairs and powers.

May the pursuit of knowledge be tempered with caution, and the wisdom to discern which secrets are best left untouched.
