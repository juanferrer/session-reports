## Adrik Silverbeard

### Backstory

Adrik comes from the wealthy dwarven dynasty, the Caebrek clan.

The Caebrek clan resides mainly in the Mror Holds. Adrik's direct family is led by Adrik's grandfather, patriarch Magrus Caebrek. He was born in the Mror Holds but moved to Breland later in life (914YK) due to a business opportunity. This is where Adrik was born, in Xandrar (south of Lake Galifar).

The family business was very successful. They would locate and retrieve ancient relics and weapons, which they would later sell to the highest bidder. Most of Adrik's youth was spent being trained in the family business. He never took much interest in the auction part of it, but he did enjoy the expeditions and retrieval of the artifacts. During the war (990YK), Adrik was drafted and he was thrilled to go to serve. His family was not as excited about it. They were about to go on an expedition to Xen'Drik and they needed everyone's collaboration, so they tried to convince him not to go. When he refused, a family council was called and the conclusion was that Adrik would not go to the war. The fee was paid and Adrik was spared.

Adrik, loving Breland and wanting to defend her, absconded and tried to form a new identity. He moved to Sharn, found a blacksmith that wouldn't ask many questions and tried to stay undercover. A few months later, another wave of recruiters arrived and this time he offered himself for the service.

Many things happened during the war but none as traumatic as the Mourning.
After being sent home from the battlefield, Adrik found himself alone and without purpose. Back in Sharn, he started learning about magic and how it could empower his combat abilities and turn him into an outstanding warrior. He also continued practising his trade and working on and off.

He doesn't know how the Xen'Drik expedition went, how his family is now and they probably don't know about him either.
