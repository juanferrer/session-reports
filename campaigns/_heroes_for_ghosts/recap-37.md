With Elora and RIP apparently petrified, Abel and Adrik doubled down to try and defeat the angels.  But the wild magic effects were playing havoc with Abel's spells; first causing her to glow with a bright light and then to unexpectedly turn into a pot plant!  To their horror Elora and RIP were not petrified but aware of their surroundings with time slowed down as the creatures fed off their lifeforce causing two years to pass for them over the course of twelve seconds.  As Elora and RIP phased back into real-time, a couple of up-cast lightning bolts, several hard hits from Ardik's axe and finally a toll the dead from RIP finished off the Angels.
 
Investigating the ziggurat, the party found it to be inactive.  Not having a handy C-Pad they settled on using one of the arcane charges to try and damage it.  RIP volunteered to cast meld into stone and carry the charge deep into the structure to maximise the damage.  As he completed that ritual he inadvertently summoned a unicorn from the forests of Olarune!  As he emerged from the stone he was able to persuade him to let him ride it to the exit.  Unable to climb the rope the pointy-fae-horse (Taun) teleported to the surface and had a brief conversation with Elora in elfish before vanishing back to its home plane.  The charge detonated and did a decent amount of damage to the ziggurat.  Our heroes returned to the surface for a short rest.
 
The next door opened up to the corridor with the silence entity which RIP sent off down the hall once more with thaumaturgy before they opened up to a room made of flesh.  Abel spotted the corpse of a Kundarak dwarf and attempted to levitate over to it.  Not wanting to be left outside, Adrik, Elora and RIP stepped into the room and several monstrous creatures emerged.  A horrifying eight-limbed spider woman webbed Abel and nearly killed her before she teleported to a corner of the room.  After expending a lot of resources and suffering a great deal of damage the monsters were defeated and another red key rune was recovered from the dwarf.
 
Desperate to replenish their magical resources the group opened and closed doors several times until they found the boardroom they had previously cleared of undead and settled down for a long rest.  They were able to get their rest although Elora had to deal with a swarm of insects trying to get under the door.  They proved a theory the door connections changed when they were opened rather than closed as the sound of the swarm ended when opening the door.
 
Cycling through more rooms the party found one of the missing Reforged (Locket) who told them his party had been split-up after one of them was killed by a monstrous creature in the vault.  They were also able to describe the archive room that contained the House Cannith documents.   The group had kept the previous door propped open and so had to clear the blocked doorway to the north to avoid closing the route back.  Adrik had some difficulties in lifting the rubble,  Elora gave a fantastic performance making it look like she cleared it, while RIP and Abel did the real work.
 
Beyond the rubble they found the exterior door to the vault and RIP did an inspired job of picking its complex lock (30 lockpicking).  Unsurprisingly the door did not open to the vault but to the archive… a couple of teeth ghosts were quickly CC'd and killed and after a bit of searching the Cannith records recovered along with the location of a Orien lightning rail carriage yard west of Metrol.
 
The door was cycled once more to gain access to the vault proper.  As soon as they entered the room the bony monstrosity leapt at RIP and Adrik grabbing our warforged and teleporting him to the back of the room while dealing a devastating amount of damage.  Elora spotted and cooked the rot grubs with a lightning bolt and RIP banished the boss to a demi-plane giving the party a precious few seconds to plan their attack…
