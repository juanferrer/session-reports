**Start Date**: 13th Nymm (early morning)

We began the session with a fight in the stacks of the Great Library at Flamekeep. Through a mix of spells, weapons and crushing the party managed to defeat a number of nothics along with some unknown shadowy creature… But not before the rather unpleasant underkeeper was slain by one while cowering in his office. RIP cast gentle repose on underkeeper to allow the Keeper to pay to revivify him if he chose to.

The party explored the rest of the basement and came across a tome of devouring - a magical book capable of devouring the contents of other non-magical books and transcribing their contents into itself for later reading. It currently has one entry on "The World's Greatest Bard" by Elora.

The party then spent the rest of the day accessing material in the library on a number of subjects they wanted to research:

RIP learned about genders and was left more confused about them than when he started.

Able learned about the planes of Eberron and how to access the Astral Sea - mostly with a high degree of difficulty - though some technology made by the giants of Xen'Drik peaked her interest.

Elora sought out information on petrifaction, its causes and cures. Learning basilisk oil was one possible cure, along with basilisks could be found in the mountains to the East of Talenta Plains. She also investigated legendary bardic instruments without much success but did learn Xen'Drik was a known source of powerful magical items.

Adrik researched The Daughters of Sora Kell, learning a good deal about the current leaders of the Monster Nation, Droaam. He also looked into 'The Outsiders' but found mostly spurious third hand information written by Human authors. It was implied that a better source would be the much older records of the Orcs in Darguun's capital Rhukaan Draal.

The party boarded their flight to Kornth and from the privacy of their cabin Elora and Able decided to experiment with the ground up Sybris Crystal and the speaking stones. Elora confessed her stone had connected to her handlers during the war and Able revealed she had her own stone that connected to her handlers in The Trust. Both women discussed throwing the stones overboard to rid themselves of a regrettable past - but they held off for now and considered if it might be possible to link the two stones together.

They decided to swap stones during the experiment. Able would try Elora's stone that had not worked since the Mourning. And Elora would try the stone taken from the crazy stowaway. Both would use some of the golden dragon powder. The plan was to see if Able had just hallucinated the voices on their last attempt.

Realising they lacked the strength to grind up the crystal they enlisted a reluctant Adrik after persuading him of the need to experiment with the stones. RIP attempted to prevent what he saw as drug abuse by sneaking into the room unseen and trying to cast a spell to purify them. Able, startled by the sudden appearance of RIP when he started his ritual, lost control of her bowels and had to go clean herself up.

The ritual was completed but had no apparent effect on the dust and Elora was able apparently to make contact with the beings on the other end of the stowaway's stone - while Able heard nothing when using Elora's stone. Without comprehend language however Elora was unable to decipher what was said. 

Adrik had a "Good talk" with RIP - who mostly listened and stared at the dwarf.

In Kornth, RIP bought a diamond for future revivifications and Elora purchased a horn that looked identical to the one RIP had been tormenting the party with; she was also able to swap the two via a high sleight of hand roll.

The Party boarded the train to Vedykar and Elora dealt some cards…
