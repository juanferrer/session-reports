Right before we went in we talked to a halfling. He said there are many guards in the castle.

“There’s tunnels through the barracks. Room on the left.”

“Mahari” is the third witch?

When she detonates the CPAD no one should be within 80 feet. If she dies, we are to look for Lily Quad at the Gathering Stones and tell her what happened.

Going into the cave, we fought some skinless creature and then a Mind Witness (kind of like a beholder). Then we crossed a room with creepy priest statues which, according to the Gods, we should not blink to two of them. We put two eyes from RIP’s collection in front on them. A bit further down the room we found the Three Sisters discussing something about the Ziggurat.
