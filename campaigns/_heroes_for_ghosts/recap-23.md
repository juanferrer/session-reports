**Start Date**: 2nd Lharvion (Mid-morning)
 
With Pan eagerly filming with his Scry Cam the party leapt into battle with the medusa and her stone minions. A couple lumbered up to Adrik scratching at him with their petrifying claws. Able bravely tried to cast mind spike on the medusa but was forced to look at her while targeting the spell. The medusa's stare was too much for the gnome who instantly turned to stone. Now with their sense of danger heightened the rest of our heroes pulled out all the stops, a blindness spell from RIP neutered the threat from the medusa while Adrik got to work with his Phase Axe and Elora began blasting lightning bolts. Soon the medusa and her minions were slain.
 
After carefully examining the pool the remaining party decided to try dipping in the garden gnome to see if it would reverse the petrification. It did not. After testing with her hand Elore entered the pool, followed by Adrik and RIP who was carefully carrying Able. It turned out to be a portal leading to a medium sized room that was clearly the abode of the medusa. The party looted a Clockwork Faefly, a quick writing quill made from a pegasus feather, a bag of beans and a collection of books. Before leaving, Adrik took the medusa's head and dress, thinking Able might like it. The dress that is… not the head.
 
Back at camp the party rested and RIP prepared the sending spell so they could check on how to brew the depretification potion. Elora was keen to start on the ten day journey back to Gatherhold but RIP counseled caution, wanting to wait until they had revived Able. A sending was sent and Toquil replied… RIP quickly wrote down the instructions using the quill. Following the instructions to the letter they managed to produce five doses. Testing one on Able they were extremely relieved to find it worked. As she began to turn back to flesh RIP slipped the pegasus quill into her bag. A further two sendings were received from Toquil:
 
> Read about a group who had been on something called a Scry News. They were employed by a big game collected called Toquill of all things.
> Takes me back to my Xen'Dirk days with Stinky Tagos and Unholy Kendel. But better keep my name out of it in future though. Mums the word.
 
The journey back involved:
- Some toad licking
- A failed Jhaala hunt
- A profitable raptor egg retrieval
- Successfully taking down a stegosaurus
- Healing an injured Saaya hunter and returning him to his tribe
- A great deal of reading…
 
In addition to several members learning about vampires, The Demon Wastes, The Vol religion, cooking on the road, bedroom magic, and the royal history of Galifar they also read the diary of the medusa (Amedee Drosin). They learned she had been cursed some 20 years ago by a group of witches from Shadowmount Forest after seeking a wish from them. Ideas of collecting on a bounty were floated as was the possibility of seeking out these possible wish givers themselves.
 
Ten days later…
 
Arriving at Gatherhold the party could see the town was buzzing with activity. The surrounding hills chock full of tents belonging to all the Laths of the plains and their entourages. Elora sought information on Lath Sharbul amongst the camps and learned he was in the town and had made arrangements for their accommodation at the Grand Hotel. Deciding to split up so not to be so recognisable as the famous four; Elora and Able sneaked past the crowd reporters; Sas and Pan strolled in as a distraction; and RIP and Adrik attempted to slip in unnoticed. RIP proved to be too recognisable and was quickly surrounded by reporters. Able set off a stinking cloud as a distraction as some House Ghallandra porters pushed back the crowd and ushered the party inside.
 
Our heroes were whisked away by a concierge to the royal apartments. A luxuriant permanent Mordenkainen's Magnificent mansion. The concierge revealed herself to be Chevian d'Ghallanda, daughter of the head of the House (Yoren Ghallanda) and grandniece of Lath Sharbul. She thanked the party on behalf of the House and gave them a Ghallanda token that would grant them free accommodation at any of their establishments. She spoke about her work on expanding the reach of the house so they might offer safe services in far-flung and exotic locations from Droaam to Q'Barra and maybe even to Xen'Drik. Before leaving she suggested the party pay a visit to Off The Cuff tailors in the Talavaar Souk where they might get some new clothes, possibly some shiftweave.
 
The party enjoyed a few hours downtime in the apartments with their ethereal butler Rilan transforming it to provide whatever their hearts desired, including a very large bath for Able.
 
Lath Sharbul stopped by and explained how the Conclave would work. Sixty two laths would draw a panel of seven judges. The prosecution (Sivis lawyers) would call witnesses and present evidence and the defence (also Sivis Lawyers) would present the defence on behalf of House Jorasco. Sharbul explained the two prosecution lawyers were keen to talk to the party about evidence and them taking the stand. The party asked he invite Meriele to the apartments and to let Pan and Sas know they would seek them out.
 
 
**End Date**: 12th Lharvion (Afternoon)
