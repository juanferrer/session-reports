They haven’t noticed strange effects on themselves, like we noticed on RIP. Maybe House Keneth should look into RIP. They are interested in the records kept from House Cannith in the Palace of Earth. They want us to clear it out.
So, options:

- Kill the Watchers and the Overseer (or a deal)
- Retrieve some Kaiba Dragonshards from the Palace of Winds
- Clear the Palace of Earth and retrieve some records from house Cannith kept there.

We decided to go to the Palace of Winds. We got in and found some mourners in there.
I also found some rune stones found in a sort of lawyer’s office. The runes are for the elements, like fire and stuff. We found 8 of them, one unique.
Also, we managed to get to the entrance of the vault. Able stood at the front of the “control panel” and a voice said “Kundarak authorization acknowledged”. What? Dwarven ancestry?
We solved it and got to a place with 8 doors. 8 runes also, huh.

After a horribly complex puzzle, we got in and found 15 strongboxes and a dead dwarf. He had a set of keys and a green rune stone.

In the strongboxes we found:
- 1848 gold
- Several bags of diamonds (3x50gp, 1x350gp, 1x400gp, 1x1000gp)
- Zafu of the Wandering Mind (I-am-your-god mat)
- Life Tether Ankh
- Silver coin of Olladra
- Sphere of Annihilation container

The dwarf in there died on 22 Alerun 994, two days after the Mourning.
