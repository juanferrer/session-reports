**Start Date**: 10th Dravago (few hours after midnight)

Following the failure to sneak behind the intruders into the vault the party quickly launched into combat. The two fighters engaged the group while the third individual took advantage of the deactivated anti-magic-field to cast Knock on the vault gates. RIP made use of the fireball grenade which caused significant damage to the vault cracker as he opened the final gate. Meanwhile heavy fighting at the stairs nearly killed Adrik as he attempted to defend Elora. 
 
With one thief down the other two attempted to continue to reach the device they had come to steal. Elora incapacitated one of them with Tasha's Hideous Laughter, helped by RIP's Bane spell. The second thief was killed and the third disarmed, restrained and revealed to be a shifter. The party made their way back upstairs to investigate the intruders they had left in the kitchen. There they found a half dressed Toquill with one dead intruder and the other magically held.
 
Both survivors were interrogated and RIP announced he wanted to remove their eyeballs for his collection! The party, thieves and the DM were left wondering if RIP really collected eyeballs; though RIP later claimed he didn't. The party concluded the group in the Kitchen were patsies paid to lay the blame on the Zilargo Purity of Power (elemental rights) group. That survivor was let go after he gave a description of the person who hired him that matched the woman had made the offer to Elora a few days before.
 
The survivor from the basement was less susceptible to intimidation until Elora started removing toes! Then they learned he was a member of the Daask gang (an up and coming organised crime group from Droaam) who said his boss had been told to steal the CPAD. The individual (who identified himself as Conny) claimed he did not know where it was to be taken, only it was to be loaded onto a cart that would be waiting out front. Adrik rushed to the front of the house just in time to see the cart pulling away.
 
Toquill asked the party to help dispose of the corpses, not wanting to involve the Watch. The party came up with the simple, yet messy, method of cutting them up and dropping them into the sewer connected to the privy (negating the eight much more complicated methods the DM had considered!). Adrik kept well away from this grizzly business, occupying himself with cleaning up the kitchen.
 
Next day, once rested, the party set out to gather clues on the group behind the attempted heist. They learned the woman had been seen in the terminus district and a receipt was found connecting one of the dead thieves with a blacksmiths shop there. After a quick stop to spend all their recently acquired gold on healing potions the party headed down into Terminus via the lift at Tavick's Market.
 
The horribly racist dwarven smith at Arms of Steel (Baeramore) pointed them in the direction of a nearby inn (The Excited Duck) where she'd seen 'the foreigners' meeting. Inside the tavern the party questioned the friendly barkeep over breakfast but became aware there was something wrong with him. Able cast detect magic and learned he was under the influence of some kind of enchantment. Realising if they wanted more information, they would have to have to pay a magewright from House Jorsco to remove the curse, the party scrapped together what little remained of their funds.
 
Once cured, Bellubar was able to tell the party a group of three woman had been meeting regularly in his bar. They had recently started meeting with another local Dunroy who did not seem himself (assumed to enchanted). What really confused the half orc was his old commander had been with the women but when he tried to talk to her she had not recognised him. It was at this point one of the women had placed the (Geas) enchantment on him, forbidding him of talking about the group.
 
We ended the session with the group arriving at Dunroy's dairy business in Terminus and Adrik spotting the cart that had driven away from Toquill's manor on the night of the attempted robbery.
 
**End Date**: 11th Dravago (afternoon)
**Loot**: 400g and a rod of collapsing from Daask thieves. One box of assorted spirits worth around 50g from Bellubar.
