The witches may have survived, as the CPAD just sends everything trapped in the vortex to the space between planes.

After arresting the chief, Nordar told us her story and that of her kin. She mentioned aberrations that roam our plane that were created by a war between the goblin-kin and the orc-kin and this other race. The Ziggurat is a portal between our world and theirs.
The “daughters” mentioned by the witches may be the leaders of Droaam. Three very powerful witches, much more powerful than the three sisters. There probably are more Ziggurats.
