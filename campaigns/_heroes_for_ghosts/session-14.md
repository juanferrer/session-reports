Mix, a warforged alchemist, is taking business from Abel’s friend. He’s apparently charging unfairly low prices. It risks her closing shop. He’s staying at the Moon Sugar.
People seem to be addicted to the potions of healing he’s selling. We think he’s putting something in the potions. RIP cast Detect Poison and Disease and he recognised “Tenebrus Acepit”, known on the street as tarbeast. We were hesitating to take it directly to house Jorasco, as they have been into some dubious business before. In the end we decided to actually do it and take a witness with us. They did seem genuine about their concern, so it sounds like it’s not so bad. They arrested Mix and that was that.
We got an interesting Restorative Ointment and a Potion of Spell Recovery. We should find some Crawling cabbages.

In Vathirond we found an adventurer that did attempt the Mournland lightning rail quest. The rest of his party got wiped. The first night they camped and they heard a scream of the watcher during the first watch. After a claw came out of nowhere and killed one of them. Then they attempted to leave. Some maggots came out of the corpse of the other one and killed the last one. He thinks it burrowed right into his brain.

We got to Flamekeep in the end. Gregory Manatain is willing to do anything to get his boss’ job. He works at the library. He may be useful for us. The keeper is called Caleb Batcher. He will help us out with a speedy processing of our membership if we help them out with some spiders in the basement.
