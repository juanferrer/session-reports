Turns out the deck makes illusions. Oof, that was close.
We finally arrived at Gatherhold. At house Jorasco they seem to be getting volunteers for something. The refugees are being relocated to do some work.
We got some information on where they could be, got a guide, dinosaur mounts and are ready to go.
