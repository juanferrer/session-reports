Abel examines the Codex and learns about the second unveiling. She finds the index and learns that all the other unveiling books are on loan to the various Daelkyr. Elora finds a book of forbidden jokes. Adrik finds a book called Whispers of the Abyss, Studies of Otherworldly Entities. RIP finds Cursed Culinary Chronicles book.

We step back through the portal, and the beholder librarian, incensed at our book thievery, immediately attacks. After being beaten to within an inch of his life, the librarian agrees to make us library members after all. During the fight, two orderlies come in and we take care of them after the librarian backs down. We all agree that as library members, our "stolen" books are in fact just on loan and Adrik picks up some free bookmarks.
We head over to the female ward on the east wing, passing doors to the kitchen, chapel of chaos, and treatment along the way. We speak to Irina who we determine is The Collector due to her collection of invisible butterflies.  She tells us of the Surgery, we learn that we can enter by placing aspects of flesh, metal, mind, magic and time in a circle. We also learn that Aria has been taken to surgery, and we piece together that the Surgery is the lair of Xos.

Elora speaks to Evangeline, a woman with no face who is gazing up waiting for the moon to wax.  She refuses to speak about the Unveilings, but directs us to Linda.  We find Linda sobbing over a book, and realise she is the one Control mentioned, the Weeper.  The names of the dead appear in her book and she cries for them all.  She tells us Vral'a'yak resides in the Chapel of Chaos, but we will need to return to her later as "it's not yet time".  She also mentions someone called Ylara, who we think may be the Stargazer.

Next we find Serafine, who falls to the floor in worship of Elora, insisting that Elora is her goddess Selune. When Adrik mentions Evangeline, Serafine starts hysterically shouting about her being a fraud, attracting the attention of the dreaded nurses! We all managed to hide in time, however the nurse attempts to take Serafine to Treatment which Adrik will not stand for. Battle ensues, and we call upon our last reserves to fight the mindflayer nurse. As other asylum staff joined the battle and wild magic took its unpredictable toll, things seemed hopeless and Abel started to ready the planar gate for a desperate escape. But RIP was thinking fast and used anti-life shell to cut off the reinforcements while Adrik managed to finish off the nurse. Elora granted Serafine her "divine powers" to smite the enemies of the Goddess and Serafine promptly ruined the other nurse with an insanely powerful moonbeam, and Wished one of the orderlies into Treatment, while Adrik mopped up the last one.

Exhausted and battered as we are, we realise this is probably our best opportunity to finish interviewing the rest of the patients while the asylum staff are out of action.
