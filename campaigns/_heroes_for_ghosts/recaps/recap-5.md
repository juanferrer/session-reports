**Start Date**: 11th Dravago (afternoon)

We leapt into action with a tense fight between the Party and the spirits haunting Ms Ain's apartment. During the fight Adrik was possessed by the ghost and had to watch in horror as his body was forced to attack his friends. The possession was ended in a novel way by Able who put Adrik to sleep, thus denying the ghost use of his body.	The dwarf got his revenge when he destroyed the ghost a few seconds after being woken.

A quick investigation of the apartment turned up the items Tinx needed to keep running the agency. RIP was also able to determine the magic circle was some kind of necromantic ritual used to bind spirits. On returning the items to Tinx, the goblin woman thanked the party and asked on their travels they check in from time to time at House Sivis offices so she could let them know about any lucrative contracts.

Back at Toquill's the Party rested and identified the magical items found on the bodies in the apartment before asking Toquill if they could delay helping him dispose of the CPAD until the following night. Some shopping was had and Elora headed to the Tumbledown district to seek information on any surviving members of the Darkbrood family. In The Gypsy's Gaze tavern she spoke with a local man named Verner, who said he believed there were some Darkbrood's in the New Cyre refugee town. He also explained Oargev Wynarn (Queen Dannel's survivng son) ran the town as 'King is Exile'.

That evening the party aided Toquill in his plan to dispose of the CPAD. All they had to do was load the crate onto the cart and drive it a few hundred meters to the local park without been seen. But what happened was Adrik nearly dropped the crate while loading it; struggled to keep the cart under control as they set off (but managed it with a bit of Guidance from RIP); Able tripped over a railing while trying to sneak through some bushes (blinded by her lit rollup); Adrik lost control of the cart when Trevor (the donkey) started to rapidly speed up; Elora attempted to calm the donkey but only spooked it more when she suddenly appeared from the shadows; Able remembering how effective the Sleep spell was in the ghost fight used it on the donkeyâ€¦ which collapsed to the ground and was promptly run over and killed by the speeding cart; with the sudden stop the rowboat shot over Adriks head and skidded across the grass into the park!

From there things went a bit smoother, with the CPAD parts loaded onto the rowboat and sent out onto the lake. One of the warheads was triggered with a shot from Elora's crossbow. The Party watched as a vortex was created around a tear opened to the Astral Sea; the rowboat, CPAD and a fair amount of water from the lake was sucked into the rift before it sealed itself seconds later. The whole event was captured on Toquill's magical picture box.

Two days later it was time for the Party to board The Bernard Castle for their trip to Trollanport. Near the docks Elora gave a gold coin to a Cyrian beggar who was muttering something about "they're not gone", he went on to snort some crushed up amber crystal before holding a sending stone to his ear and apparently hearing voices from it.

On board the ship the Party met the crew, took part in some payers to a handful of gods from both the Nine (Sovereign Host) and the (Dark) Six. There was an allocation between the House Lyrandar Harbour Master (Adfir Reathran) and captain Greenbottle. Adfir claimed he had finally figured out how Greenbottle was smuggling contraband and ordered the smashing of a statue. It turned out to be solid marble - containing no contraband - and he left in a frustrated rage. Elora checked the ship for stowaways without finding any. Able looked for magical items which just turned up a clock in Greenbottle's quarters that contained a small amber crystal.

Finally a fine meal was had at the captain's quarters and many tales were told. Greenbottle explained he'd inherited command of the vessel after the previous captain was eaten by the mimic on an expedition to Mimic Island (where she had intended to tame one). When the topic of the Mourning came up the captain spoke of his lost love (Enzana Selevarun) who he believed to have perished that day as she was a member of Queen Dannel's queen guard in Metrol. The Party retired for the evening mostly taking up bunks below or on the deck so not to look privileged in front of the crew.

**End Date**: 14th Dravago (nearly midnight)

**Loot**: 150g each, a cloak of useful items (Elora), horn of silent alarm (RIP), cast off scalemail (Adrik), spellbook (Able). +whatever is left from the gold given to you by Toquill.
