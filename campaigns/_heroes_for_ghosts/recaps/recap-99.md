As we have cleared the staff from the wing, we take the opportunity to interview the remaining patients on the female ward. We meet Elana who is making a clay model of Xakin. She says she can help us, but not yet, and we should return when the sculpture is finished. In the next room we find the girl who needs winding up, and Abel winds her and thanks her for her earlier help. Next we meet Mara, who promptly fades into the shadows until no trace of her remains.

Moving on, we find the room of Lucienne, the whisperer, the woman who had killed one of the nurses with her mind. She tells us that the kitchen requires a blood offering to open the door, and that once inside we will find Buttercup on a butcher's table. She recites a delightful poem called Buttercup's Lament, from which we gather we may be required to stitch a dismembered cow corpse back together. Quickly. We also meet Ylara, the stargazer, who demands star charts. Abel quickly draws some asterisks on a piece of paper, and Elara happily accepts this. She tells us that we need Cedric the seeker to open the hall of mirrors. We donâ€˜t recall meeting anyone named Cedric, so perhaps he will be found in one of the lairs.

Having spoken with all the female patients on the ward, we head back to Xen'Drik, had a nice meal, caught up on some correspondence and got a much needed night of sleep. The following day we went to the Bazaar and did some shopping. We had a Heroes' Feast for dinner, and Elora created Babel, a simulacrum of Abel. Abel is not too happy about this, but does wonder whether or not a simulacrum has a soul, and if so whether this could be used as a get-out-of-devil-contract-free card.

Returning to Xoriat using the planar gate, we make our way toward the Surgery to face Xos. Inevitably, we almost immediately find ourselves in combat again. This time it goes much better apart from the bit where Elora almost died. After a short rest so that Elora could staunch her wounds, we headed into the Surgery, finding two doctors standing over the unconscious Singer, discussing how to stop her singing. We quickly rushed in to save her. After giving the doctors a taste of their own medicine, we moved on to find a room with two operating tables laden with human remains. We placed the aspects within the circle: A bloody steak for flesh, an iron arrowhead for metal, a self-help book for mind, a magic scroll for magic and a tiny hourglass for time. As the last aspect was placed, a portal opened and we prepared to step into the realm of Xos.
