**Start Date**: 21st Barrakas (Afternoon)

Adrik restrained himself for a moment and the party sneaked forward, placing the portable hole on the windows to the central chamber. Slipping down our heroes were able to surprise the witches. Elora transformed the miniaturised Lyesrin into a T-Rex, breaking her free of the jar in which she was imprisoned. Abel cast dominate person, which caused Salmon to use one of her legendary resistances, Adrik dashed to and viciously attacked Salmon with his phase axe.

As the witches recovered from the surprise and retaliated, Coteh made an attempt to bring the Sphere of Annihilation down on Hjuldrak but could not muster the mental acuity and was mocked by Elora. A punishing strike from Salmon broke Elora's concentration on the polymorph and Lyersrin returned to dwarf form. Abel unleashed magic missiles as Adrik continued his axe onslaught. RIP attempted to silence the two witches near Adrik's father but could not stop them bringing the SOA down on the dwarf's legs - obliterating them and causing him to lose consciousness.

Tish joined the fight flanking Salmon to protect their mother. RIP attempted a banishment, but to no avail and moved to stabilise Adrik's father. Abel wrestled mental control of the Sphere from Coteh.

Mahari and Coteh closed in on their sister and the cluster of Caebreks. The combined attacks had badly bloodied the lead witch but she disregarded the threats and prepared a spell. Counter spells were cast and counter cast. As her sisters reached her they grabbed Tishnar and Lyesrin and linked hands as Salmon released the spell. The last words spoken before they teleported out were thanking them for delivering what they needed.

The two drow captains finally closed the distance to the party and the first poisoned attack against Elora dropped the elf. The drow did not hold back and stabbed down twice more - killing her! Seeing the situation deteriorating fast the party rallied and focused on the drow that had dropped Elora. The other drow made a run for the portable hole, snatched it and made a suicidal dash towards the SOA. Mere seconds away from causing a catastrophic planar explosion Abel managed to levitate him and hold him off the ground for the others to finish him off.

With the battle over, RIP took one of the party's diamonds and called back Elora's spirit from Dolurrh. 

In the aftermath the party rested and considered what to do with Hjuldrak. Wanting to get him to safety but aware they could not take the SOA through the gate. Before Adrik's father regained consciousness they had settled on Sending to Lacey Omaren asking her to go to the Gate location and using the Cubic Gate to open a portal there. Adrik had a reunion with papa, who was delighted to find his long lost son was alive and well but distraught at the loss of his legs and capture of his wife and daughter.

Pan reluctantly swapped sizes back with Varhoe and RIP's pet drow (Brlian) was returned to normal size in exchange for further information on the witches' plans. Abel and Elora watched a replay of the witches teleporting out, to try and ascertain what spell had been used - with careful study they learned it was the Plane Shift spell and got hints it may have been used to teleport to somewhere on Eberron. The map table showed the remaining sites and Brlian confirmed they were probably taking Tish and Lyesrin to one of them. The party compared the map to their Khyber map and considered which routes to take. Elora scryed on Salmon and found her to be interrogating Tish about how to gain access. Storm giants were mentioned and the sounds of lapping waves could be heard so they figured they could be at Aqua.

As Hjuldrak was handed off safely to Lacey and the Omaren guards the party received a call on the Scryphone. Zorlan d'Cannith (head of Cannith North) wanted to know the location of Amber and was willing to compensate them well for his faction to be able to study the tech contained there. Conflicted about handing over potentially dangerous technology they agreed to get back to him…

The party returned Zorlan's call and asked for an airship! The house leader mulled over the request, admitting that while his house made the vessels they were owned by House Lyrandar and required a dragonmark to operate. After some persuasion he relented and agreed there probably was a small vessel they could be issued… along with the four customised Cannith Brooms ™ they were owed. Trying to hide their excitement they signed off, promising to seal the facility before they left and send him the access codes.
