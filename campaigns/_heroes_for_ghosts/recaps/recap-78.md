**Start Date**: 25th Zarantry (Morning)

As we exit the portal, the castle is under attack. A group of githyanki and mindflayers drop in. We take care of them, and head into the throne room. Shan Syaen says they have things under control there, but orders us outside to help his people.

Outside is Mahari with a bunch of giff and a big old mindflayery thing. And one of those creepy gigantor giff motherships. We start trying to get into position to attack Mahari. Elora turns herself invisible, which proves to be fatal as RIP doesn't realise she's in the middle of his sunburst. Adrik manages to do some damage, but also falls unconscious. In an act of desperation, Abel puts herself right in harm's way and succeeds in dominating Mahari, who (compelled by Abel) very thoughtfully orders the giff ship to retreat, and then assists RIP in finishing off the enemy forces and reviving our fallen allies.

Then RIP adds insult to injury by casting Geas on Mahariâ€¦ looks like we have a new friend for a while! Mahari does not seem very happy about this turn of events.

**End Date**: 25th Zarantry (Morning)
