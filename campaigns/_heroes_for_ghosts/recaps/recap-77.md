**Start Date**:  24th Zarantry (Midday)

While Elly was out doing our shopping, we spent some time reviewing the prophecies, and one in particular stood out "There comes a day when the lady in red reveals her true self, no man shall mark the rise of two empires and an end to the monarchy". Control was wearing a red dress on the day she got the ability to assume the Queen's likeness.

After a somewhat inebriated Elly returned with our winter woolies, we parked up a mile out of the castle and headed sneakily for the sneaky entrance. This was going quite well until Elora stealthily bumped right into a polar bear. We tried bribing it with an apple, and threatening it with an illusory polar bear, but no dice (at least no good ones!). It attacked, but after RIP and Adrik smacked it a couple of times, it changed its mind and booked it. We came across some really large birds (definitely dragons), which Elora drew away with a minor illusion. We found the stream, along with some horrible leggy thing which beat up Abel and Pan a bit until it was dispatched. Elora diverted the stream, allowing us to head into the cistern.

Inside we met Fraxia, some kind of watery creature, who was happy to listen as Elora regaled her with a heavily embellished tale of our encounters with giants. In return, she told us the castle's lord is named Shan Syaen, and that he is a bit tetchy due to the castle not moving in so long. Benevolent heroes that we are, we of course offered our help, and followed Fraxia's directions towards the great hall. Before we could get there, the cook intercepted us and demanded our help with making dinner for the "Grannies". Adrik made soup cold, Elora spiked the steak, Abel made some explosive cocktails and RIP made eyescream.

We served dinner to the Grannys, three old but powerful hags, and they liked it so much they gave us some boons (Abel would really like to know what would have happened had we chosen "booms" instead). Abel got floppy ears to help her hear, Adrik got three random poison vials, RIP got a frog familiar, and Elora got a bad makeover. Moving on from the Grannys, we reached the prison and paid our respect to the formidable bird-dragon who seemed to be in charge there. It just pooped on the floor. Adrik seems to think this is some local custom. I hope he doesn't poop on the floor when we find the Lord. Elora chatted with the prisoners, a human who got scooped up by ice warriors, and a fairy who apparently turned the lord into a boar.

Carrying on, we finally found the lord. Rather than the instant death or imprisonment I was expecting, he treated us to dinner -  a heroes feast with some very interesting drinks! He told us that the castle usually travels at his will, only staying a few days at each place. But almost four years ago the castle was pulled here, and he has not been able to move it since. On arrival, a mysterious portal leading into a Khyber pocket appeared in the castle cellar. Shan Syaen suggested that the castle is from Thelanis, the "book" of the prophecy, and that the "anvil" may refer to Fernia, the plane of fire. Seems like the City of Brass might be a good place to start.

We went down to the cellar to check out the portal, and popped in to have a chat with the resident, Jedra, another of the Dalkyr. He was all smarmy and superior, making comments about how he's seen ALL our shows and particularly enjoyed the ending. Elora attempts to read his thoughts and almost gets compelled into playing the CulStrat for him, but Adrik stops her in time. Jedra seems very fascinated with our artifacts - its pretty evident they are connected with the Dalkyr somehow. We should probably look into that at some point.
