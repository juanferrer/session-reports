**Start Date**: 23rd Barrakas (Early evening)

Elora returned with the mask and announced "we've gotta go now!". The party started swimming for the exit, but with the knowledge they had no chance of out swimming the dragon turtle in open water. Putting Lyesrin, Pan and Varhoe in front Adrik and RIP stayed behind and readied spells. Feeling the pressure wave of the turtle forcing its way through the tunnel, Elora prepared wall of force. As soon as the creature appeared the bard released the spell and trapped Mythka.

Making the best use they could of the ten minutes the spell offered, the group swam to the surface and ran breathlessly into the forest beyond the lake shore. From a small rise they saw the creature surface and make its way to the beach - but after failing to pick up their scent, it returned to the depths.

As the group rested, Adrik was able to catch up a little more with his mother. Elora (rather abruptly) broke the news about Hjuldrak’s injuries and Lyesrin relayed the message the witches had given her; Lyesrin was told by Coteth that "should her son manage to rescue her and acquire the mask they should go to Cadmium and take the weapon from the forge there to the final site. If they bring the mask, armour and scythe to Verdant they will exchange them for Tishnar." If they do not they will send parts of her to them until they comply. Coteth also told Lyesrin how the group could access the Khyber route to Cadmium.

Abel examined the mask, noting its connection to the school of divination and decided to attune to it - giving up her Zephyr Cushion (which was passed on to Adrik). RIP used divination to determine a rhyme that implied one of the awakening rituals for the mask would be for it to travel through time. Thankfully they had realised before leaving Aqua, but mindful of everyone's exhaustion they decided to find and camp at the old Stone giant village. Varhoe was sent to hunt and RIP made a passable venison stew - at least better than the usual nutrient paste.

The following day Varhoe was left looking after Lyesrin while the party (followed by the ever protective Brlian) returned to the depths. Elora and Pan accompanied Abel, both dimension dooring into the room with the time machine. Abel activated the machine but forgot to tell Elora to let the magical effect take her, so while Elora stayed in the present, Abel was sent 13 minutes back in time. She dimension doored back out with Pan to find the party not there and spent a worried few minutes waiting - as soon as the (past) party descending from the surface caught up she popped out of existence. They pondered what this meant - it must be the future Abel they saw below but what had happened to Elora? Perhaps the elf should remain behind? They decided the problem might be down to them causing a paradox and perhaps they should try leaving the mask in the room after time traveling and this time Abel would go alone… once more she dimension doored into the room and this time found the activated mask waiting for her - she wondered how many times she'd been through this loop and how many disembodied Abels and Eloras there were out there in alternative timelines…

Making it back on land without encountering the turtle or giants they set off on the three day journey to Cadmium. Along the way Abel completed her Giant language lessons, Adrik made progress on his poisoner studies and RIP got the hang of cooking real meat!

Binders End turned out to be situated at the foot of a very active volcano. In the ash covered landscape the party could make out a giant settlement to the east and more structures to the north. Adrik tried out the zephyr cushion and scouted the settlement - finding it to be of a good size with at least a hundred fire giants making it their home. It looked like modern giant construction rather than the refined ancient Cul'Sir so they decided to try exploring the structures to the north.

Built into the sides of the volcano was a mining complex that looked of Cul'Sir origin. Adrik made use of the arcane eye once more and found some humanoid creatures that were reminiscent of warforged. These protoforged were working mining machinery. The group decided to ascend to the mining platform via a mine cart and test if the beings were hostile. The protoforged paid no attention to the party and did not seem to understand common when spoken to. Abel tried giant but they dismissed her commands. When RIP was pushed forward as an ambassador his dragonmark itched and the protoforged immediately started paying attention to him, calling him Prozvodel (maker-commander in giant). Talking to them revealed they were similar to warforged before their emancipation, they performed the tasks given to them largely without question and giving no thought to what they wanted. RIP gave a stirring speech about freedom and the protoforged seemed to accept this as a new order and began gathering up more their number to be freed by RIP.

The cessation of activity on the ore production line drew the attention of the fire giant overseer who stomped over from the west platform to investigate. He was met with the party prepared and in hiding and a 400lb, levitated chain dropped on his head by Abel for a record breaking 114 damage. The giant bisected one of the protoforged but was quickly cut down by the party and their new allies. Searching through his pockets Elora found a picture with "world's best dad written on it".

Making their way to the other platform the party freed another protoforged, handed out weapons and filled trunky with as many adamantine ingots as it could carry. A second fire giant was lured out and set upon by the small army. Toll the dead (RIP), magic missiles (Abel), lightning bolt (Elora), a volley of crossbow fire (Protoforged) and a devastating 103 damage from Adrik with his poison laced axe… with the fire giant clinging on, Brlian, seeing his 'friends' in danger, dashed forward and drove his sword into the targets thigh. Blood sprayed over the drow as he savoured his first kill!

**End Date**: 26th Barrakas (Midday)

 - Episode was not received well by the audience. The time travel meant large sections of the show made no sense. People were disappointed with the lack of combat or shenanigans with the turtle or storm giants. Viewing figures may take a hit.
- 24th & 25th Return dive to activate mask and travel (no show, added to next episode)
- 26th Revolution at Binders End! (Still filming)
