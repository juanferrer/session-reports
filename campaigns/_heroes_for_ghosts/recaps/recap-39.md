**State Date**: 1st Barrakas

Sachem handed over his two green key runes after the party explained they needed them to get into another of the vaults in the palace of earth and possibly retrieve a SOA. The Reforged leader apologised to Pan and mended his Scry camera with the caveat there was to be no filming in Making. Elora immediately asked Pan if she could borrow the camera to explore the site, but learned it required a Sivis dragon mark to operate. Abel offered to use her arcane eye zafu and sat down to project her vision across the site and down into the mine shaft.

A few hundred feet below the surface the wizard explored the dimly lit interior; noticing the Reforged chipping away once molten stone that seemed to have flowed into the buried structure. Several times her projected vision passed over the enormous smooth boulder in the middle, her brain not able to see what it really was because of the scale. Then she saw what it really was: the head and upper torso of a buried Warforged Colossus! Estimating to be at least one hundred and fifty feet tall, the gargantuan construct was at most one quarter uncovered. After watching the progress the workers were making she guessed it would be weeks if not months before it was fully uncovered. Attempts at determining if it was functional were inconclusive. Obviously concerned about his intention, the party decided not to challenge Sachem on the colossus at that time, but to ask him in the morning about what they were digging for.

While the party rested, RIP spent some time with the Warforged and Elora watched from the deck of the Limiting Factor after finishing her trance; neither spotted anything else suspicious. In the morning they let Sachem know they were heading back to Metrol and were introduced to Prize, a Reforged who would send them any messages should Sachem need to contract them.

On the ride back to Metrol, Abel penned a letter to her lost brother and summoned the devil Hasanas. The fiend enjoyed a (morning?!) whisky and smoke with the gnome while extolling the 'virtues' of the second pact, before agreeing to take the letter to her brother Ammeron and confirm delivery.

After another rest the group was once again in the Kundarak vault in the Palace of the Wind attempting to arrange the runes into a configuration that would open the door. When it did open they found a verdant curtain of plants obscuring them from view by a congregation of cultists. One of the cultists taunted a prisoner while a second was sacrificed on an altar. Adrik was reaching for the close button when RIP leapt into the room and magically silenced the chanting. A vicious and prolonged battle ensued leaving the party spent and ten cultists dead.

Once freed the prisoner introduced himself as Varhoe. It transpired he was a guide from the enclave of Stormreach, the main non-native settlement on Xen'drik! Varhoe explained the dark-skinned elves were Drow, a major threat in the region. He offered to act as their guide to lead them through the jungle to Stormreach as thanks for the rescue and an audition for his services for onward travel. RIP cast gentle repose on the corpse of Varhoe's former employer and stuffed it into Trunkie for possible later revivification. Varhoe warned there would be more drow in the temple as the party considered what to do next.
