**Start Date**: 3rd Nymm (just after midnight)

Though it may feel like longer, your journey started a mere four weeks ago in the Brelish city of Sharn. There a wealthy patron (Toquil) hired you to guard some weapons, that he was apparently studding on behalf of the Brelish security services; looking to see if they could have been responsible for triggering the Mourning. When one device (known as a CPAD) was nearly stolen by a group, who had also offered you pay to take their side, you set out to investigate. During the investigation, RIP started his eyeball collections and you learned of the involvement of a group of changelings and apparently a orcish General from Darguun (Nordar).

Having thwarted that heist you left Sharn in search of the gnomish inventor of the weapon - seeking to learn if there were others that the group might attempt to retrieve.	That took you onto the ship known as the Bernard Castle, captained by the halfling Green Bottle. A man who Elora learned had been in love with (and had an affair with) her Aunt in the Cyrian capital of Metrol.

A speaking stone was retrieved from an apparently crazy stowaway which when used in conjunction with a narcotic known as Golden Dragon caused Able to apparently make contact with entities speaking strange alien language - which upon translation was something about a door, captives and the sea. Though as Golden Dragon is a hallucinogenic there is some doubt if the voices were real.

Trollenport was a stressful homecoming for Able, as you soon learned she had connections with a shadowy organisation based there known as The Trust. Kelben Lignenhall (the man you had travelled there to find) was befuddled and was unable to provide much useful information. You met the man's daughter who begged for your help - claiming The Trust was responsible for her father's lack of faculties. You declined to help her and decided to leave the city after Able had been warned not to interfere by The Trust. On the way out however you stumbled on a Trust archive and retrieved some documents that listed the locations of the other CPADs and showed that Ables brother had been involved in the program - apparently sacrificing himself to stop on of the devices falling into enemy hands.

You moved on to Groshk - a town in Darguun where you knew the changelings had been headed. There you found locals being driven mad by some hidden power and located the imprisoned heroic leader of the Darguun army (General Nordar). She explained she had been captured when coming to Groshk intent on uncovering a ziggurat - an ancient artefact leftover for a war with alien that had invaded the continent millennia ago. The changelings had been trying to find out how it worked and where Nordar had stashed her CPAD.

You battled your way to the ziggurat and eventually fought the three witch-changlings there - killing at least one of them. Nordar destroyed the ziggurat with her CPAD and apparently caused one or two of the remaining witches to be sucked into one of the vortexes. She later explained that those sucked into the vortexes are not necessarily killed but merely deposited somewhere in the Astral sea - giving Able some hope her brother might have survived that ordeal.

The woman known to you are 'C' arrived at Groshk to meet with Nordar and lent you her airship which you used to get to New Cyre (the refugee town housing those who managed to flee Cyre before the Mourning). Elora had been eager to search the town for members of her family and did find her uncle (Keafir). He at first mistook her for someone called Meriele and then when he realised who she was called her by a different name (Theeala) and let her know her sister had survived. He said Meriele had left for the Talentra Plains a few weeks ago, as some part of a settlement programme run by House Jorasco. He also told her about the possibility that his wife and Theeala's mother might have survived the Mourning… because of a secret plan to protect the royal family in the event of a massive attack on the capital. 

It is late afternoon and Keafir had returned to the manor house to finish his shift on guard duty and left you in his modest home…

**End Date**: 5th Nymm (late afternoon)
