After doing some shopping in Krona Peak and eating a delicious heroes feast, we shifted to Xoriat. On solving a riddle to open the Warden's quarters we immediately met the Warden, which would not have been that surprising except it was an elder brain wearing a top hat. That was definitely surprising. He gave us a somewhat cultish sounding sales pitch, then "suggested" we wait quietly in the waiting room and not cause trouble. In the waiting room we met Evelina and her dolly. After Abel wound up the dolly, Evelina was grateful and gives us a list of people we should seek out: the man of numbers, the puppet master, the weeping one, the whisperer, the collector, the one who looks up, the seeker. She says each of them holds a piece of the puzzle, and the oldest child holds the key. She also tells us the male ward is through the western door.

A nurse comes to collect Evelina, and Elora sneaks out the door left open by the nurse. She discovers a courtyard area, with a patient singing. Abel snaps the more suggestible among us out of their need to sit quietly, and finding ourselves unable to open the western door, we head back to the medical room and get that door open using Abel's exceptional artistic ability.  Inside, we find a dead staff member and Lucien, who mostly speaks in whispers, so we're suspecting she's the whisperer. She claims to have killed the nurse with her mind. She tells us our thoughts shape the fabric of this place, and she knows other secrets but doesn't trust us enough to tell us. Then the chair sort of eats her. We find a patient list in a desk, and Abel starts noting which of the persons of interest we have located against their names, and crossing out the less useful ones we come across.

We head back to the east wing to talk to the singing woman, who doesn't actually talk but manages to communicate by singing at us. When we tell her we need to get into the west wing, she guides us to a staircase in the room next door, and distracts the nurse so we can take the stairs. Coming out in the west wing, we proceed to interview the inmates one by one.

We come across an undead child playing with blocks. The blocks are stacked in such a way that Abel recognises them as a one-time-pad key for the planar gate, and Adrik translates "reason, mania", giving us a gate back to this place. RIP also finds a cypher-shifted easter egg.
We find Xander the puppet master. After convincing him we are the protagonists and asking him how the story ends, he tells us in the heart of the asylum there is a machine where we will witness the 7th unveiling and use the machine to alter the reality of this place. We must complete the other 6 unveilings first.

We speak to Oberon the Bard and politely decline his invitation to join his adventuring party, and Sorren who maintains an invisible machine in his room, or would do if he hadn't been waiting forever for a replacement part. We promise to keep an eye out and let him know should we come across a suitable part. Able crosses both of these inmates off the list.

Much to Elora's relief, we find her father Himmo in one of the cells, in reasonably good health and sound mind. He has come to realise that freeing Quillion was not one of his finer moments, and is devastated when Abel somewhat cold-heartedly informs him of Cyre's demise. But he seems to regain some hope when Elora tells him that Shaeva and Miriele still live. We decide to send him to safety in Xen'Dirk, hurriedly scribble an explanatory nonfortunately the resulting wild magic causes Abel to become confused - fortunately she is dazed and clinging to the ceiling so the nurse sees nothing amiss when checking in the room. Abel starts wandering randomly in her confusion, but Elora restrains her until the confusion wears off.

Continuing down the hall we find Ozymandias the Bookkeeper who has been struggling to sort his books. We quickly tried to send through the portal ahead of him, open the portal and throw the note through. The noise of the planar gate opening attracts the attention of nearby staff, so we hurriedly shove Himmo through and close it. Adrik hides in a nearby empty cell, RIP hides on the bed under the blanket, Elora very cleverly uses the immovable rod to hide at ceiling level, and Abel not so cleverly tries to imitate this tactic by casting spider climb. Urecognise the correct ordering (much to his annoyance), which spells out Words are the Key, unlocking the library and giving us access to destroy (or be destroyed by) Vaster.

Lastly we encounter Felix the mathematician, who tells us that the 2nd unveiling can be completed by forming a magic circle in the library. We should delve into the library's arcane texts to find the necessary instructions and the law to arrange the symbols. He doesn't know the details of the other unveilings, but believes the 1st is connected to the kitchens.
