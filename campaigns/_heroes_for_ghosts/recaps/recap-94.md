**Start Date**: 22th Olarune (10 pm) **Now on Astral Time x10 Eberron** - Astral Date 131447

We message Nordar to ask her to head to Pelmarane. We board the Reformed Optimist (BBs ship). Abel and Adrik start seeing weird reflections and hearing screams and discordant music as we get closer to Lharvion. Arriving on Lharvion, RIP creates a Temple of the Gods for us to stay safe in while Abel attunes. Adrik goes exploring with Elora and Ammeron, and cuts a sample from the weird brain mushroom tree roots, which screams horribly. Elora starts chasing a shadowy figure. They come back after 20 minutes, but in the Temple 9 hours have passed. We finish attuning the rod and then planeshift to the Crag after saying farewell to BB.

We are surprised on reaching the Crag that time has not run the way we expected - we thought it had been 28 days, however the Sora Katra informs us only 4 days have passed. The Daughters offer to resurrect Control as anything, but we vote to keep her as Control. We contact Nordarr who tells us that she has succeeded in capturing Salmon and destroyed Xos. RIP suggests to drop her in the Deep Ward of the Dread Hold. We check in with Lysee, who is busy concocting a smokescreen for why the queen has disappeared. Arriving at Rhaan, we manage to con our way on to a smuggler ship, when the smugglers mistake us for members of the Fey Court.

Once we reach The Grove, Silarus takes us to meet Zephyrath, a scholar who has access to the Daelkyr. He recaps the history - 10k years ago Astral Time (100k yrs Eberron), the Githzerai were fascinated by Xoriat. They encountered Outsiders. There was peace for some time, then 6k years ago (AT), the first great war erupted. The Outsiders made an adjustment which cut off Eberron. The Githyanki sided with the Outsiders. The Githzerai barely survived for thousands of years, but 700 years ago the Outsiders became distracted by something on Eberron and the Gith rallied and captured four of the Daelkyr. Several months ago a refugee from Eberron (Elora's father) started communing with the Outsiders. It was decided to move the Outsiders to split them up and they start with Quillion and Zakin, but Elora's dad stowed away on the ship transporting Quillion, and the rest we kinda know. He gave us 2 books written by Niara Nith, about the Outsiders and Xoriat.

He then takes us to see the two Delakyr they still have imprisoned. As we wander around the chamber, Zeph comments that the Forbidden thingy has dropped. Elora activates TrueSight and immediately notices the horrible brain things at the south end of the room. Elora alerts Abel, who manages to get a message to Adrik. We enter combat with Daddy Brain and friends. Elora banishes Daddy Brain for a round, and Abel uses anti-grav to play pogo with some mindflayers.
