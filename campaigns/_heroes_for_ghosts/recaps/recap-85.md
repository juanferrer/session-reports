**Start Date**: 6th Olarune (Afternoon)

Iron the Warforged took Elora's place, very confused as it had recently been scheduled for dismantling after some "incident" at the prison. We convince it to help us break back in.. Iron is only too happy to help us free the "creatures" from the "zoo".

We take the brooms down to the prison dock, leaving them hidden underneath, and head into the tavern which the prison guards tend to frequent. Finding an extremely drunk guard, we cart him up to our room for a "little rest", though upon arrival his rest turns out to be somewhat longer as Krek slits his throat, steals his unlock token, and tosses him out the window with a little help from Apex. Krek makes seaweed grow to help hide the body. Meanwhile downstairs Iron spoke with some of the patrons about the evil of dwarves and how they should all be murderised. Apex and Krek hastily rushed Iron upstairs and out the window before any guards started taking too much notice.

Their efforts were in vain, as Iron encountered a guard outside the tavern and after a very short lecture, proceeded to grapple the guard and take him for a little swim. More food for the fishes. We then scaled the infirmary tower, Iron murdered the guard at the top for his key, and threw him off the tower. Heading inside into the Infirmary, we encounter Ruth the prison chaplain, who repays a debt to Krek by agreeing not to turn us in, and asks us not to harm anyone. Krek points out it may be rather unavoidable, but she will promise to only finish a fight, not start any. (The other two don't promise any such thing.) We did also learn the names of some of the guards working Gold wing: Horrack, Gwinellin, Grackam, Miskwin

Heading into the laundry, we find a dwarf fixing one of the industrial washing machines. Iron pushes him into the machine and turns it on. After the initial spin cycle, Iron pulls the bones out from the remains, stowing them in a bag of holding, then puts another wash cycle on with LOTS of bleach. We did get another somewhat mangled key token. As we were exploring the laundry, two more guards arrived on the elevator - one of them hit Apex with a very effective stun stick. We managed to take care of them, and took the stun stick and an anti-magic grenade that they were carrying.
The body count is currently at 6, and we have key tokens for Infirmary Tower (unknown if this also unlocks other towers), Red Ward and Stone Ward.

**End Date**: 7th Olarune
