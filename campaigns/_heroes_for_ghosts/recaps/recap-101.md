**Start Date**: 12th Therendor  (10am)  - Astral Date 131449

After killing Xos, Elora searches the theatre, finding some nice poisons for Adrik and a book of anatomy.  We make our way back to the male ward, letting Elora scout ahead to talk to Cedric, who it turns out we already met briefly and dismissed.  Cedric prompts Elora to look into a shard of mirror, where she sees an alternate version of a past event in Metrol where we all died instead of succeeding in our mission.

Elora asks Cedric if the mirror can be used to change things, and using all her power of concentration she chooses one pivotal moment in our entire history to change the outcomeâ€¦ and now we have a BadAss donkey which carries our gear instead of Trunky.  Elora concentrates again, and makes a change so that the door to Jedra's hall of mirrors is unlocked.

We head back to Eberron, and call in all our favours from all our allies to take out the Delakyr still imprisoned in Eberron and the Astral Sea.  Control gives us the teleport circle for Wroat, and we go there to meet up with Ellie on the airship.  We fly to Talenta Plains so that Abel can send Ammeron back to the Astral Sea. He will enlist Sashem to destroy Riman. With things growing ever more deadly, we take a night out for a meal with friends and family, and Adrik and Mirele get reacquainted.

A couple of days later, Ammeron sends word they have succeeded in destroying Riman, which is our cue to return to Xoriat.  Making our way to the kitchen we find a dismembered cow, Buttercup presumably, and fail at putting her back together in time, forcing us to fight Apocalypse Cow. Fortunately we are much better at taking things apart than putting them back together, and Apocowlypse is destroyed.
