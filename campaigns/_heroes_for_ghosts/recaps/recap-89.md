**Start Date**:  10th Olarune (4pm)

We retrieve our brooms, visit the manticore pen and spend the night in the Governor's quarters. We convince the new Captain to allow us to make a documentary episode about Dreadhold, assuming we survive the cleanup.  Almost as soon as we get to Deep Ward we encounter Hrigrella. It is able to do a terrifying amount of damage at a time, and it uses an ability which makes Adrik ravenously hungry. This turns out to be a tactical error when Adrik starts eating it to death, so it switches this ability on to Elora who starts trying to eat RIP, however the greatest risk here is that Elora might chip a tooth. Abel uses Feeblemind to turn the demon into a drooling idiot and Elora uses Bigby's Hand to shove it into a room we can lock it in.

Moving to the control room to check the CCTV, we notice a lone surviving guard in cell block B. We turn back on the magic lockdown features in cell blocks A and C, then head to cell block B to rescue the guard. When we come face to face with him, Elora realises something isn't right and shoots him, prompting the demon wearing the guard skin to reveal itself. RIP banishes it.  We find the corpse of Harak d'Khundarak, the late Governor. Elora gets a Silver key from the corpse, which seems to be the master key to Dreadhold.

We decided we should try to get Hrigrella back into a cell, so we come up with a cunning plan where Abel will be bait and get it to chase her into the cell. While the plan was cunning, the execution was poor, and Abel gets knocked unconscious before RIP manages to banish the demon. After reviving Abel, we decide it would be a good idea to tend our wounds and get a good night's sleep before we try to take on the last demon. Captain Rotda is mildly disappointed we haven't cleared everything out in one go and that we keep banishing things, but does give us a file of all the current Dreadhold prisoners. Funny how there's no mention of Shaeva.

Later that evening Elora has a snoop around the Governor's quarters and finds the off-book prisoner log which records Shaeva and Matchbox Man incarcerated at the request of Control, plus Radrop at the request of House Kundarak. She destroys the section regarding her mother and puts the rest back. She also finds a teleportation circle. Later, as Adrik is falling asleep, he receives a vision of Sora Katra insisting that we come and see them as they have important information.

**End Date**:  11th Olarune (7am)
