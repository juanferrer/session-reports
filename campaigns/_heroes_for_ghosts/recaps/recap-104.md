**Start Date**: 21st Eyre (11am)  - Astral Date 131453

Picking up the fight with Jedra, Abel uses Feeblemind to turn him into a drooling moron, but our apparent victory is short-lived as Bedra returns from the Maze. Adrik kills a minion by sitting on him and RIP grows a long beard made of feathers.

We finish Jedra, which just passes his powers to Bedra, who promptly goes all out on Elora seems to be on the brink of death, but RIP pulls her back. RIP banishes Bedra while we finish off his minions. We get ourselves prepared to finish Bedra, but when RIP drops the banish spell we are confronted by a gold dragon which uses its terrifying breath attack to good effect. Deducing this is likely a polymorph spell, Abel pulls off a ridiculous Dispel Magic, returning Bedra to his normal form, which Adrik promptly smashes into the ground.

We pick up: The unveiling book, a warping mirror and a strange potion (1 dose) which allows the drinker to use mirror step as a reaction for 1 minute.

**End Date**: 2nd Dravago (8pm)  - Astral Date 131455
