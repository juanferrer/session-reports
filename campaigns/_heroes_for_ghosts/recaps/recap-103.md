**Start Date**: 21st Eyre (11am) - Astral Date 131453

We return to Eberron, and spend some time studying the items we got from Riman. Adrik determines that the cleaver is sentient, and creates a terrible bloodlust in its wielder. He thinks it might be best to destroy the cursed item, if we can figure out how. RIP discovers the horrific bag will exchange flesh for money and vice versa, though nobody is keen on eating any flesh being produced by this bag. Abel reads through the book, which describes the ritual for the first unveiling. She attempts a translation of the ritual verse:

> *Words (ecstasy?)â€¦ Slow*\
> *(welcome?) master of evil*\
> *Bloody shadows bar*\
> *The abyss bound, revealed*

We rest up some, do some shopping, and pop to the Astral Sea to catch up with Mero via sending, asking him to come back to the asteroid and we will meet him back here after we take care of some more Daelkyr. Elora creates a simulacrum of herself, I think we are all shocked its taken her this long. After RIP cooks us a glorious Heroes Feast (Abel is really getting used to eating 1000g meals every day) we get a good night's rest, then its back to Xoriat.

Almost immediately Elora manages to run into an orderly, and trying to fast talk the creature only results in Elora almost being forcibly escorted for Treatment. During the inevitable fight a mirror in the hallway gets smashed, and afterwards as the party are discussing the location of the entry to Jedra's realm, Abel remembers the poem Cedric gave us and realises we need to smash the rest of the mirrors. Doing so reveals the portal, and jumping through we find ourselves in a long, mirror-lined hallway of mind-bending proportions, with a floor that appears to be swirling and flowing into holes. Very trippy.

Jedra is on hand to welcome us with a traditional rant in the Daelkyr style, and battle is joined. Belora gets turned into a goat briefly, and then a B-Rex. RIP recognises the mirrors could be a threat or weapon somehow, and uses earthquake to good effect, breaking most of them. His hunch is justified shortly after, as we see minions emerging from and returning to the mirrors. Jedra spawns a reflection of himself, which we quickly banish. The episode ends on a cliffhanger as the battle continues with the outcome still very much undecided.

**End Date**: 22nd Eyre (10pm) - Astral Date 131453
