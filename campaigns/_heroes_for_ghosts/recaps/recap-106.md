Returning to Xoriat, Elora manages to sneak into Elana's room without immediately triggering a fight. Elana gives her a clay figure of Xakin with two female figures lurking behind. On examining the statue, Elora feels a sudden compulsion to go to the treatment room. Convenient, since that's where we want to go anyway. As she passes the staff room, the elder brain pokes itsâ€¦ brain?... out the door. A fight nearly starts, but Elora manages to convince everyone that we were going to get treatment. Even after RIP and BIP hit one of the orderlies with Toll the Dead. That girl can talk her way out of (or into!) anything.

On reaching Treatment, Elora again uses her powers of persuasion to talk the staff into demonstrating the rather awful looking treatment process on the clay doll, very helpfully triggering the portal. We rush in, finding ourselves in an environment that looks like some kind of terrifying laser disco or the inside of a kaleidoscope. Xakin gives us an excellent speech about how he is the Harbinger of Salvation, then invades our minds trying to find and materialise our worst fears. Adrik's fear of dying alone, old and frail, with no-one to know or care took shape as a creature with the ability to suck away time. Belora's existential crisis about her potential impending non-existence manifested as a creature composed of void.

RIP promptly banished the time-sucking creature, and we managed to dispose of the void creature. The fight against Xakin was a tough one, featuring much lightning and a brass dragon (fortunately this time the dragon was on our side), but we managed to beat him. Elora takes his Resonant Robes - very awesome lightning armour, and we get his unveiling book.

From here we head to the Astral Sea to check in with Ammeron, then on to Talenta Plains, and for one lovely evening on the sunlight plains we forget our troubles, our enemies, and saving the world, and just enjoy the company of friends and family.

**End Date**: 7th Dravago (8pm)  - Astral Date 131454
