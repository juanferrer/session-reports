**Start Date**: 11th Dravago (afternoon)
 
Arriving at the dairy the party was met by a man (Mitchell) who informed them it was closed, mentioning they'd got no milk as the cows had stopped producing. They learned from Mitchell that Dunroy (the owner) had recently fired all his workers and didn't seem to care about the failing business. The man said he'd only stayed around because no one was looking after the cows. Able stayed with the man at the gate while the rest of the party confronted Dunroy. Elora accused the owner of conspiring to steal weapons of mass destruction, which he denied before having one of his 'workers' started a fight. Dunroy attempted to flee after one of his men was cut down and beheaded by RIP's Spiritual Weapon (a shovel) and another put to sleep by Able. Briefly incapacitated by Elora's hideous laughter spell Dunroy recovered before ranting about how useless the party were meant to be before escaping by some unknown magical means. 
 
Interrogating the captured thug (with a now reoccurring threat by RIP to remove his eyes) the party learned they were hired by Dunroy and were meant to have collected the CPAD the previous night if the heist had been successful. A coded letter was found along with a clue that included the word Vqswknn and Toquill's address. Both Able and Adrik realised it was encoded with a letter replacement (onepad) cypher and VQSWKNN was the code for TOQUILL enabling the rest of the letter to be decoded by Adrik. The party also investigated the putrid smell coming from the storeroom and discovered the badly decomposed body of Dunroy - quickly realising the one they had met was a changeling. The changeling (identified as Coteh) also dropped a leather bag which Elora believed to be a bag of holding, though turning it inside out and placing a coin and an eyeball produced inconclusive results. It was later found to be magical, imbued with some unknown form of necromancy and made from human skin!
 
Leaving the dairy in the hands of their new friend Mitchel, the party returned to Toquill's residence. Along the way they picked up a copy of the Breland Bugle which had a headline referring to the dismembered body parts that had been found in the sewers and an appeal by the city watch for information.
 
After updating their patron of the afternoon's events Toquill asked if they would be willing to travel to Trolanport (Zilargo's capital) to track down the inventor of the CPADs to see if there were any others the conspirators might attempt to acquire. Toquill was in the process of dismantling his own CPAD for disposal, after deciding it was too dangerous to keep around. The party agreed and set about running some errands for him…
 
A cart, rowboat and ancient donkey was acquired at bargain prices - what Toquill's intentions are for them remain unclear. The party enquired at the docks about ships travelling to Trolanport before settling on The Bernard Castle, a galleon captained by the flirtatious halfling Greenbottle (the one captain the house Lyrandar harbourmaster had warned them was a bit dodgy). Free passage was agreed as long as the party provided security for the voyage.
 
A trip to Swords and Staffing was made to hire new house guards. There they found Tinx distraught as her boss (Ms Ain) had not been seen since the day after the party was hired, some five days previously. Tinx explained she had gone to look for her but felt very uneasy as soon as she entered the apartment, believing some Ogech Gharlen (Evil Magic) had been done there. So she had sent a fighter and a wizard to investigate two days ago but they also had not returned. She explained without Ms Ain or her AK (Aandi Kjunn - a magical fob used to assess accounts at House Kundarak banks) she would not be able to pay anyone or keep the agency running. Suitably financially incentivised they party set out to investigate.
 
Inside the apartment signs of a struggle we found, including what looked like human fingernail/claw marks in the hallway and a trail of blood leading through the property. After a few attacks by an unseen assailant Able had the good sense to put all the sharp objects in the kitchen cupboard before they could be turned into projectiles. The living room contained the dead bodies of the wizard and fighter previously sent to investigate, who both had on their person a number of magical items which were looted for later identification. Elora cast Faerie Fire and revealed the spirit that had been attacking them. A crossbow bolt, a few magic missiles and one hit from Adrik's axe later it was quickly dispatched. The final room revealed a gruesome scene; a skinned human corpse in a ritual circle made from its entrails, some arcane words written on the wall and two ghosts. Roll for initiative…
 
**End Date**: 12th Dravago (afternoon)

**Loot**: 20g each, a human skin bag and several unidentified magical objects (cloak, horn, scalemail, spellbook). + whatever is left from the gold given to you by Toquill.
