**Start Date**: 26th Zarantry (About midnight)

After killing Kifu we head out to save the slaves. We stopped off at Kifu's office, finding his storyboard for megaprofits and a secret ledger which proved they've been fiddling the books. Adrik says tax evaders are the worst, and he doesn't even feel bad for killing Kifu. Continuing on, we encounter some Azir who promptly sick a golem on us. We take care of that along with the Azir who were too stupid to run. Picked up a few shiny items from the warehouse.

On reaching the slave dorms, RIP banished the guarding golem, giving us a few minutes to free the slaves. RIP tried to use his ultimate ability to break one of the locks, but only succeeded in creating a tidal wave of food and water. Eventually we manage to rescue: Dune, a harpy from The Crag; Scarlet, an aladrin from some fey spire; Gerhardt, a human from Aurendar; Rhinamar, a bugbear from Volar; and the previously mentioned lizardfolk Gakmam.

We return to the chain room with the slaves, finish breaking the chains, and use the cubic gateway to escape the collapsing facility. On arriving back in Xen'Drik we ask the mercenaries to return the slave refugees to wherever they need to go, apart from Scarlet who hopes to hitch a ride to Taer Syraen, however when we got there it had already moved on. We can attune a rod in the Demon Wastes in order to return her home. The portal, the prison and the prisoner remain after the departure of Taer Syraen. We have a quick chat with the Daelkyr who is still ranting about how they're going to win. Whatever.

During our travels, Pan received a call which sent him into a rage - apparently his LARPing first mate has mutineed along with his crew, leaving Pan without ship or crew for PirateFest next week. Obviously we agree to attend PirateFest and be his crew, punish the mutineers, and with any luck, crown Pan the Pirate King of the festival.
