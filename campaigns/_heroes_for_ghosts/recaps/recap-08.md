**Start Date**: 23rd Dravago (late evening)
Adrik, Elora and RIP met with Folly Lingenhall in The Hare's Hair, where they agreed to help her get her father away from The Trust in exchange for his notes on the CPADs. Suspecting Able had been taken by The Trust they arranged to meet with Folly in The Black Flagon the next morning.
 
Setting out to look for Able the rest of the party retraced their step along the docks - eventually finding the pram abandoned by the woman who took Able. They found it contained a doll that was making 'baby noises' and interrogated an onlooker under zone of truth. In the midst of deciding what to do with the doll Able returned to the party and they made their way to a quiet part of town to attempt to have a private conversation, away from any eavesdroppers. Attempts were made to take the doll apart but the party struggled to damage it - eventually it was left in the street. 
 
Able explained she had met with The Trust and thought they should leave Trollenport asap - not getting further involved in the Kelben situation. She warned the party they while The Trust might not be 'good', they might have valid reason for wanting to keep Kelben befuddled; given his work in producing the CPAD WMDs. Torn between the promise they had made to Folly and Able's warning the party eventually agreed to stay on The Trust's good side and leave town the next morning.
 
A trip to a House Orien office presented a number of travel options but the party opted for a booking on an airship to Zolanberg (30g each 1.5 days flight) followed by a lightning rail train up to Sterngate (2.2g each 8 hour journey ) and a day long coach trip to Groshk (1.2g). Tickets were bought for the first leg of the journey.
 
Folly was spotted at the Orien office and confronted by the group - she was angry at them for refusing to help her father and made a final desperate plea for their aid. In the end she stormed off but not before Able noticed an address on the back of a photogram she was carrying.
 
With a few hours to spare the party decided to check out the address which turned out to be a tailors shop but it was quickly realised the Trust had some involvement in the place. Inside Able distracted the proprietor by asking for his assistance with trying on a blue sequined ball gown while Elora investigated the other changing rooms. Elora encountered a magic mirror who we would later come to know as Richard Ghastly. After a torrent of insults it became clear the mirror needed a passphrase to let people inside - the solution being the opposites of the words scratched into the nearby bench.
 
Always -> Never
Coming -> Going
From -> To
Take -> Give
Me -> You
Down -> Up
 
A passage behind the mirror revealed an elevator leading to three other levels. Not wanting to split the party Adrik sneaked up on the shopkeeper and knocked him out. The party descended first to the bottom level (No Admittance) and found it guarded by two mechanical constructs. They left them and retreated to the next floor up which contained a conveyor and some crates. RIP tried to get in a crate and enter the conveyor but the machine rejected it without a label. The party went up to the first floor and made use of the machine there to search the archive - finding there was an entry for Kelben Lingenhall stored@L7.R275.3 12.2.995YK. They printed up four more labels with the same code and headed back down to the conveyor…
 
Able decided to avoid messing around with the crate by simply sticking the label onto her forehead and climbing on the conveyor (almost exactly as the DM had planned it). Passing the label scanner Able was unable to dodge the binding process which left her restrained by metal straps. She used misty step to free herself from those and was a little over confident when encountering the next step of the process… where she failed to dodge the crate brander and received a trust logo, archive code and date branded onto her cheek! RIP going second had the benefit of learning from Able's mistakes, letting the binding machine strap only his chest and the branding machine brand his shield. Adrik going third had a panic attack and eventually passed-out in fear… also receiving a branding on his face. Elora going last decided a crate might be the safer option and passed through unscathed (though boxed).
 
Beyond the conveyor the party met The Archivist - a massive multi-armed construct controlled by a Warforged with multi-attacks and legendary actions… who RIP disabled on his second round of combat by paralyzing him. Able removed an access panel and took out a Khyber Dragon Shard that was binding the elemental powering the machine and the rest of the party finished off the Warforged. The DM made a note to give the bosses legendary saves next time :)
 
Keenly aware they did not have long before their flight was due to leave, the party located the Kelben archive and made a number of discoveries.
 
There were 6 CPADs produced, one test detonation, three lost in the Morning, one lost in a ship wreck at Glamer Bay and one lost in transit to the Cyrian front lines.
They found a photogram showing Kelben and what were presumed to be his assistants (Merxif Nackle & Myna Rofferton) along with two Generals (one Orc and the Brelish intelligence woman they know as "C")
They also took a message log relating to the CPADs deployed in Cyre.
 
With the Archivist unpowered the party could not disable the conveyor machine and exit the way they came in. Instead they had to run the gauntlet of the mechanicals guarding the elevator. Able used mage hand to call the elevator and the party fought the constructs while waiting for it to arrive. Eventually back on the surface Able left a note on the unconscious shop keep saying "You have failed the test" and the party ran for their airship… arriving just as they were being called for final boarding
 
As the airship took off the party flicked through the book containing the message logs and found the following entries:
 
**Last Message - Lt. Jotra Munggen**
General Volok issued warning to Cyrian forces at Fort Zarlor to surrender or be destroyed. Ready to deploy CPAD on his orders. Jotra out
 
**Last Message - Lt. Valpos Humple**
Something happened in Cyre. There's a purple light. Some mist approach…
 
**Last Message - Lt. Ammeron Adredar**
Massive magical explosion in Cyre. Enemy are charging our position. Self-destructing CPAD to avoid its capture. Tell the Trust to look after my sister. Ammeron out.
 
**End Date**: 24th Dravago (early afternoon)

**Loot**: List of CPADs and their last known locations, couple of photograms relating to 'Team Banshee' and a book of sending messages to CPAD field operatives.
