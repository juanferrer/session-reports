**Start Date**: 12th Barrakas (Night)

As the merfolk warriors fled the ship our heroes turned to the injured crew, picking the survivors out of the water. Captain Ty, having checked the crew were in safe hands and handed over command to the first officer, made the strange request that he be restrained below decks. He'd heard rumours that merfolk bites had the ability of turning their victims into their kind. He explained he'd seen merfolk before and while they were often hostile he'd only heard of an attack of such ferocity during the Redpole incident back in '84 (where the crew had captured and eaten a merfolk - a meal that proved fatal for the whole crew). RIP attempted some healing but realised he would need to rest and prepare some other spells to cure the captain.

The party spoke with the first mate and agreed to pitch in to help supplement the lost crew, mentioning their time with Greenbottle, who was clearly known to the officers as a well-known smuggler. RIP assisted with providing prays for those sailors buried at sea while the others helped with repairs and cleaning up the merfolk corpses.

Noting they had not seen Varhoe during the battle RIP sent his eye crawling down the side of the ship to peer into the porthole to their guide's cabin. But inside rather than the man he could see a large brown bear! As they wondered if he was a druid in wild shape they decided to keep this to themselves and bedded down for the night.

In the morning Abel and Elora started their first shift. Pan started interviewing the party and crew in place of the footage he'd missed while charmed by the merfolk. RIP successfully removed the curse from the captain and the crew successfully navigated some whirlpools with help from the party's magic. Adrik and Elora headed below deck to talk to Varhoe. After some initial anger about being spied upon, their guide revealed himself to be a werebear [flashback to his rescue in Darkleap temple where Abel had removed the silver collar around his neck and noted the burned skin before discarding the collar and forgetting about it…] He said he'd been worried they might not hire him if they knew what he was and so had not mentioned it before setting off. As a lycanthrope he was all too aware there would be three full moons for most nights during the voyage and would almost certainly have to spend the nights in bear form. He explained that while he could become a bear at will, during full moons it was difficult to resist. Not knowing if any crew were followers of The Flame he especially did not want the crew to know what he was. Adrik recalled The Silver Flame had led a savage purge of Lycanthropes the previous century and they were all but existent in Khorvaire. Varhoe confirmed Adriks theory the merfolk were a form of Lycanthrope and they could if they wanted they could pass on the curse to those they bit.

The next day brought a good day's sailing and at night the party were lucky enough to witness a Shardfall; chunks of the ring of Syberis falling to Eberron. Ty explained it happened a few times a year but almost exclusively in Xen'drik. Elora tempted fate by asking if there was any risk of one hitting the ship; as soon as the captain scoffed at the minuscule chances of that happening a meteor shot overhead! It missed the vessel by just a few feet and Abel immediately cast levitate on the precious rock to stop it sinking beneath the waves. Bringing it aboard they realised they'd snagged nearly four thousand gold's worth of Syberis shards and decided to share some of the wealth with the crew.

On the fourth day the party had their first encounter with giants. A pair of storm giants (riding orcas) came alongside the ship and demanded Trove (Treasure / Tribute). To Elora's horror Abel broke off a piece of Syberis shard and levitated it out to the giants who left, apparently appeased. Less than twenty four hours later they were back again and once more demanded Trove for Mythka . Elora cast modify memory on them to make them think they had just received more Syberis shards as a gift. The spell seemed to take effect as they withdrew once more…

On watch Adrik was first to see the giants returning for a third time, but accompanied with something much larger in the water. After the alarm was raised, Elora (sick of their bullshit) decided to stop them in their tracks with a wall of force. The giants missed the obstacle but the creature swimming between them did not. The dragon turtle Mythka slammed into the wall and was sent flying above the surface but fortunately stunned. Full ahead was ordered but countered by the storm summoned by the giants. Abel started a vortex with control water and trapped the turtle. Elora pinned an orca with reap and sew and RIP banished two of the foes. A quick strategy huddle later the party decided they'd have to scare off the giants or risk the ship being taken during their land journey. The ship was slowed, allowing the lead giant to catch up. As he hurled a lightning bolt a first RIP and then Adrik it dawned on our heroes how powerful and dangerous these giants were. Fortunately they were able to slay the lead giant before the turtle and companion were able to catch up. With one slain, Mythka collected the body and retreated below the surface… for now…

The party spent one last night on the Maelstrom before heading out for their journey to site indigo. The first few hours were spent trudging through marsh with the shorter members riding Varhoe in his bear form. Once on the dryer plains they encountered a strange but adorable cat which Elora immediately tried to befriend. Suspecting a trap Abel tried detect magic and noted it was a fey creature. RIP used his familiar's true sight to see the creature for what it really was and persuaded Elora to leave it alone. With the cat meowing outside the group hunkered down for a night camping under the dome.

Not long into their second day of trekking a strange whispering could be heard on the breeze. "All-father, Axe wielder and seed sewer" could be heard and as the others spoke up, "Ancient one, silent one, music maker…" Stopping to look around they quickly found some very out of place apple trees and realised the similarity to those they had encountered in Metrol. Those whose seeds Adrik had planted near Darkleep. Varhoe scolded them for planting invasive species from a place of aberrant magic in another place of wild aberrant magic. While the party puzzled over how they came to be here so quickly their guide reminded them about the fractured nature of reality on the continent and how time and space can work very differently here. The trees identified as The Adra-kesh. They referred to Adrik as The All-father and the rest of the party as his apostles. They warned of the tree tramplers and branch breakers who hunt for them and hunt for the All-father's family. Off in the distance the sound of giants could be heard.
