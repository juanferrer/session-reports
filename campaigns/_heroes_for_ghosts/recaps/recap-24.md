**Start Date**: 12th Lharvion (Afternoon)
 
Concerned about making a good impression with the highly professional prosecution lawyers the party slipped into town to Off The Cuff tailoring emporium. A selection of very fine clothing was purchased or ordered, with a few of the party opting for the lucky-dip shiftweave. Elora also upgraded her armour and RIP got a new shield with a face that was somewhat more expressible than his own. Able flogged off the remnants of looted spellbooks and alchemical ingredients. She used some of the proceeds to buy the feather fall spell in the hope of recharging the packs looted from Denith. Finally Elora picked up some knitting supplies to keep her urges in check and start on a nice jumper for RIP.
 
Sas and Pan were spotted and called over to the party. Sas wanted to remain at his camp with their dinosaurs but Pan was keen to join them in their apartment. He also let the party know Lysse Lyrriman d'Sivis (aka Doyen) wanted to talk to them via a newly upgraded Scry Personal Experience box.
 
Back at the hotel the party donned their new outfits and setoff for their important meeting with the prosecution, who turned out to be drunken imbeciles. More concerned about spending their expenses on the fine wines the hotel had on offer, they seemed to have done little to no preparation for the conclave. Not sparing their feelings the party told them in no uncertain terms what they thought of them and set out to talk to Lath Sharbul.
 
At the Lath's camp Elora was reunited with her sister. They spoke about Elora's dreams and Meriele confessed she too had been having dreams about Elora and her mother - though she did not remember them being as troubled as Elora's. Sharbul returned to town with the party and found Yewin drunk and Toppip throwing up. The lawyers were fired and the party volunteered to take over the prosecution. 
 
Pan brought a ScryPE box into the apartment and a meeting was held with Lysse d'Sivis (head of house). A comment about her not being there in person because "it was such a long journey from Trollenport to Gatherhold" set the party on edge. They worried about Trust involvement. But Lysee put them at ease, saying while they had made enemies with Jorasco they could count Sivis as friends. She seemed delighted with the demand for Scry Boxes the party’s broadcasts had driven. Elora asked about royalties and the Doyen said "maybe something could be worked out if Pan continued to travel with them". She said her editors had been told to keep the parties identity secret as long as they wanted and not to worry about any Sivis members who were also trust agents; she considered the Trust amateurish in information gathering compared to her own and kept them carefully controlled. 
 
Impressed and at relative ease with the gnomish matriarch the party introduced themselves with their real names (maybe not RIP?). She asked if the four of them had come across a "conspiring trinity". Que more concern about how much to trust her but the party were persuaded by Able and the story of the witch coven was told. She found it fascinating but mention of the CPAD weapons did however seem to be a surprise to her. She left them saying she needed to do more research… and failed to hang up the ScryPE call.
 
Able went to send a message to her alchemist friend Brellacaine, asking her to give evidence at the trial regarding the tainted healing potions Mix had been selling in Starilaskur.
 
The group sat down to watch the Bluehand documentary and Dr. Calla's confession. Both seemed true to how the party remembered them. The rest of the evening was spent in comfort watching the recording of the medusa lair battles. Meriele especially enjoying the heroic flourishes Adrik put on some of his killing blows!
 
In the morning the party stopped by the town jail to talk to Dr. Calla and Mr Copperkettle. The doctor said she was willing to give evidence supporting the prosecution at the hearing, but wanted protection from Jorasco. Mr Copperkettle too was willing to give his honest recollection of his work at Dakshin.
 
We left the party examining the Party in The Parishad colosseum, contemplating how they would present their case in a day and a half's time…
 
**End Date**: 13th Lharvion (Late morning)
