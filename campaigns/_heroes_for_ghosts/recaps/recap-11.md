**Start Date**: 28th Dravago (morning)

We began with a search of the ruined remains of the Ziggurat where they found the immovable rod that had been placed in the witch Mahari's mouth. It had blood on it but it was unclear if she had been killed by the CPAD detonation. Nordar explained the process of being sucked into one of the CPAD vortexes was not in itsself harmful; but anything pulled through was deposited in the Astral Sea and getting there or back was very difficult. Able realised her brother may have survived detonating his CPAD on the day of the Mourning. Nordar and Able spoke of her brother and the General described how she and Control had insisted vetting the gnomes put forward by The Trust as guardians for the CPAD WMDs as they were sent to the front lines - wanting individuals that were above reproach and not the typical Trust operatives.

Able and Elora noticed there seemed to be some kind of residual magical field left where the CPAD had detonated. Using detect magic Able could see faint clouds where each of the vortexes had been opened.

Nordar suggested Kelben Lingenhall would be a good person to ask about the CPAD vortexes and the Astral Sea - but learned from the party he was currently without his faculties (thanks to The Trust). She realised correspondence she had exchanged with the gnome had probably been replies from The Trust.

Leaving the dungeon the party came across a couple of Bugbear guards who had been sent to search the area after the implosions that had left a creator in the castle courtyard above. One was killed and the other tried to surrender before being murdered by RIP.

The Party took the General to Sheriff Trilug who, after gathering up all her officers, went with the party went to arrest Chief Grish. As The Party offered to "search for evidence" Nordar accompanied them into Grish's keep and allowed them to take a lockbox containing 2000 gold; but said full payment for aiding her and Darguun would be her ongoing support.

Over breakfast the General told group what she knew of the Ziggurat, the witches and the enemy she feared they all faced. She spoke about the ancient orcish (Dhakaani) empire that ruled Khorvaire millennia before humans and elves arrived . She described how 9000 years ago 'Outsiders' came from some other world across the Astral Sea (The Daelkyr). They brought with them their Githyanki soldiers and creating terrible aberrations to fight the Orcs and Goblins of the continent. She explained how after thousands of years of fighting they were able to push back the invaders and separate their world from ours. She told The Party her clan (The Kech Shaarat) were what remained of those who fought off the Daelkyr and it was through their writings she learned of the Ziggurat and had come to Groshk to uncover it and destroy it - believing it to be a machine of the Daelkyr used to manipulate the planes.

After the betrayal by Chief Grish the witches had come to question her; about the location of the CPADs and what she knew of the Ziggurat. When she would not tell them they started experimenting on locals and captured travelers to see if they could make it work. They did appear to have been at least partly successful before its destruction. Nordar conceded there could well be more of these Ziggurats throughout the world - though she had no more CPADs to destroy them with. She did not know what the goal of the witches was but mention of "The Daughters" suggested the leaders of Droaam (The Daughters of Sora Kell) might be involved. She warned The Party The Daughters were very powerful witches - much stronger than the three they had just fought.

After a nights rest The Party set out with Manton (from Doc Ethen Karch's gang) to search for his hideout and bring him in for the 2000g bounty. After the prisoner was nearly killed by a trap he'd failed to spot The Party decided to avoid any other traps by rappelling down into the canyon and using water walking to walk up it. This went well until Able was spotted by some sentries as she tried to guide RIP up the river. It was not looking too good for the group until Adrik was able to climb up to the archers and engage them directly. 

Making their way through a series of tunnels the group came across a stuffed crocodile making obviously fake crocodile noises; a stash of black powder barrels; a cave of glowing mushrooms; and a group of guards - who were either pushed into the river, killed or charmedâ€¦ before being killed.

We finished off with Elora sending a seductive message to Doc Karch and Able finding a long forgotten magic teleportation circle.

**End Date**: 3rd Nymm (just after midnight)

**Loot**: 2000g from Chief Grish's keep. The Party collected their army pension and pay from Sword's and Staffing
