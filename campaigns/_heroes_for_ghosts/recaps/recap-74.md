**Start Date**:  19th Zarantry (Evening)

Hard-hitting journalist Lacy Dewlie took a break from infiltrating underground alchemy workshops to visit with the heroes Abel "Bob" Adredar and Adrik "The Devastator" Silverbeard after their gripping and deadly encounter with the Karnathi forces. For your reading pleasure, The Interesting Times presents the unabridged transcription of the interview.

> **Lacy**: Thank you both for joining me, our readership really appreciates you taking time out of your crazy schedule to share your experiences.
>
> **Adrik**: Oh, yes, no problem, it's our pleasure
>
> **Abel**: Err this is water. Pretty sure my rider says whisky?
>
> **Lacy**: Uhhh right, so… before you came upon the ravening undead hordes you had a rather unusual encounter. Could you describe what happened?
>
> **Adrik**: We followed NorrDog for a few hours taking shifts to give directions to the drivers. We passed a few cities on the way, silent as usual. Continued going north, saw Waekelake and the canyon around it. Massive rift. Although the lake was glowing?! The entire canyon is glowing purple. No vegetation around it. Very, very strange. We helped NorrDog when it got stuck on the wrong side of the canyon. As we crossed we saw thousands of living spells (spheres of magical energy attached to specific spells).
>
> Abel got on her broom and the insatiable tome and tried to capture one of the living spells.
>
> And she got one! Almost falls off the broom, though. She captured a silence living spell.
>
> **Abel**: I did not almost fell! That was an epic ride-by.
>
> **Lacy**: It was certainly great to see those brooms in action! So then carrying on, you found a river of sand. Is that when you realised someone might have beaten you to the next Colossus?
>
> **Adrik**: Yes, RIP spotted some Karnathi undead soldiers in the sand. Continuing upstream we saw the colossus buried up to its waist and a part of the Karnathi army trying to get on it.  RIP cast earthquake and many of them fell off a bridge they had set up to get on the colossus.
>
> **Abel**:Basically RIP lost his shit and nuked them, took out half the force instantly I reckon
>
> **Lacy**: RIP often seems like the most unstable element of your group. What do you think made him this way?
>
> **Abel**: (snorts) Not sure any of us are particularly stable. How about that time you set fire to Sharn's Top Model to attempt to expose that she was a golem, and ended up burning down the studio?
>
> **Lacy**: … that was creative journalism
>
> **Abel**: Well, I guess RIPs got creative heroism then
>
> **Adrik**: Should I carry on with the story…?
>
> **Lacy**: Yes, you decided to fly in on your brooms, right?
>
> **Adrik**: As soon as we went in, the colossus started up. Elora put a wall of force between us and it. I think it was the commander of the Karnathi unit, he threw a ball of necrotic energy to me.
>
> It almost knocked me out. It did, however, get the broom and Pan. We all started falling and Abel cast featherfall on us. The broom went into the sand river. I will try to retrieve it later. It's probably lost, though.
>
> **Abel**: Then Elora just drops out of the sky.. I thought she'd stalled her broom, but it was a perfectly calculated freefall dive, grabs Pan and straight up again. Don't tell her I said so, but it was pretty awesome. I dropped some stunnage into the colossus head, and as I went in I see Adrik thunderblinking to engage the biggest bad guy and start walloping.
>
> **Adrik**: Things turned sour very quickly. In the fight with the knight I tried to push him off the cliff, but he was too strong and managed to resist. He then hit me with his sword and I was knocked unconscious.
>
> **Abel**: I couldn't really take control of the colossus, but there was a big red button, and I can't resist a big red button. Turned out to be a "burn the bad guys" button, which was useful. But it didn't stop the colossus swatting Elora out of the sky like a bug. Pan managed to get control of the broom, but then he got swatted too. I thought we were pretty screwed, but I managed to destroy the colossus brain just as RIP arrived to take out the trash. We fished Elora and Pan out of the sand, but Elora and Adrik were both dead. Like, properly dead.
>
> **Lacy**: What was that like Adrik? What did you experience?
>
> **Adrik**: I was in a landscape, lots of mist and people. Then I heard RIP's voice calling and I was awake in the ship.
>
> **Lacy**: I can't imagine the courage it must take to return, only to know you may face the same fate again in the future. Abel, you had a warning for the armies marching into Cyre. Would you like to repeat your message.
>
> **Abel**: No, you only get one warning. But I think we've just demonstrated we will fight to the death to stop anyone getting their hands on those weapons.
>
> **Lacy**: Well, thanks again for your time, I know you have places to go and colossus to kill, so I won't keep you any longer.
>
> **Adrik**: Thank you, good bye.
>
> **Abel**: Seriously, I can't believe she didn't bring the whisky.
