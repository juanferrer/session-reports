**Start Date**: 5th Rhaan (Afternoon)
 
So, Elora bailed out our protoforged what got banged up in the slammer, and then proceeded to give our new crew a lecture about right and wrong and how to behave. Proper irony, I reckon.
 
We set out to find Black Elly, saw some nice sights along the way. The broken bridges of Rekkenmark - the rebuilding effort is underway, but they got a ways to go yet. The ice castle Taer Syraen what appeared on the day of Mourning. If I ain't dead by the time we get through our to-do list, I’d love to explore that place.
 
Elora did a scry on Elly as we were passing by Stormhome and overheard a conversation about them robbing a barge called the Ossuary. The scry gave us a rough idea of The Orican’s location, but before we got there we came across the Ossuary and their crew, who were real excited to get rescued on account of having no power, food or water. They were pretty keen to talk to our pilot, and Adrik was totally giving them the stink-eye, kept banging on about how it was some clever trap set by Black Elly. Very unlike him to be so suspicious, either he’s finally learning or he’s got some baggage from the family trauma he’s just had.
 
As it turns out, Adrik was righter than all of us. We scryped the Baron to send someone to pick the ship up, and he confirmed that the supposed captain of Ossuary was not the captain at all. Elora dimensioned door’d down to the barge interior and found the real crew, and we ambushed the fake crew, disabling them in short order.
 
Before you know it a storm has rolled up over us, and in the middle of that storm is none other than Black Elly, dragging the thunderclouds around with her ship. Dunno what she’s feeding them elementals. The following fight must have felt somewhat like a bad rollercoaster for Belly’s crew, I threw em around some with gravity well, RIP took control of their ship and tipped them on their arses, Adrik jumped down to their ship but ended up in my gravity well, Elora jumped down too and made it real clear to Belly that we just wanted to talk… before shutting her in a force cage.
 
Seems like the fight’s pretty much over now, but the negotiations have just begun. Hope Elora’s got her game face on, cause this is gonna take a lot of persuasion.
