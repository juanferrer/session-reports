**Start Date**:  13th Olarune (Early Afternoon)

We head for the Twilight Demesne to get Scarlet home. On the way, Elora very kindly offers to give Adrik a shave, and then uses some of his beard to create an Adrik clone, which is promptly christened Badrik. His name seems rather appropriate, as he is clearly not as skilled, but after the shock wears off Adrik tries to give him some combat training to bring him up to speed.

The Twilight Demesne is an incredibly serene forest, perpetually in twilight. As Abel starts attuning the planar rod, Adrik, Badrik and Elora go exploring and find an ancient talking tree. The tree gives three riddles, which we eventually solve, though a wrong guess does get Adrik a thorough mocking from a very annoying fairy. As a reward, we each receive the ability to make one hit, check or save roll with advantage per day for the next 7 days. With the ancient tree's permission, Adrik plants the rest of Splitsprout's seeds in the forest.  Abel completes the planar attunement and takes Scarlet back to Thelanis. She spends an evening drinking Ambrosia and exchanging filthy jokes with rude fairies while the rest of the party travels to the Great Crag.

After Abel rejoins the party in the Crag throne room, the Daughters confirm our suspicions that Emily Diamande, aka Control, is (ironically) out of control. Due to a prophetic mistranslation, when the Sisters made the agreement with Control it released the Daelkyr Vasta, who now possesses or has merged with Control. The Daughters may be able to fix things, but we need to kill Control and return her body to the Sisters for them to undo the mess. Ultimately we will need to kill at least three of the Daelkyr in Xoriat to mitigate the threat they present to Eberron.

With some very difficult fights ahead of us, the Daughters offer to help us unlock the remaining powers of our Cul'Sir artifacts to give us some advantage. Adrik gains the power of flight, and the ability to protect his allies. They take us to the Astral Sea and show us the two dimensional starfish and their haunting melody. Elora accompanies them on the Cul'Strat, unlocking the ability to redirect a successful counterspell. Abel's final ability can only be unlocked on Zorat, but will allow her to use the mask to avoid harms. RIPs scythe gains the ability to absorb the magical potential of its victims, or to convert a fallen enemy's soul to an ally for a short time.

The Daughters explain how to release the Daelkyr in order to kill them. We must draw a magic circle around the prison, place 13 Khyber shards around the circle and chant a spell. 12 shards will be consumed. Knock should be cast on the remaining shard to complete the ritual. Before we depart, RIP begs the Daughters for a final boon - he wishes to be able to taste, so he can improve further on his cooking skills and understand the experience that the rest of us take for granted. The Daughters agree, and use a wish spell to grant him taste buds. RIP spends the journey to Wroat trying all the foods he can find.

On reaching Wroat we disguise ourselves as "not ourselves" and spend an evening in a bar frequented by Palace staff. Elora chats up a couple of the guards, and from the information she gets we decide to infiltrate the palace grounds by posing as guards. Shockingly one of our cunning plans actually works, and we reach the secret passage to the throne room without any issue. We overhear "Control" dispatching one of her spies to the Dreadhold to get more information about what happened there. Then we overhear a conversation in guttural speech (possibly between Quillion and Vasta?):

> *"What is our status?"*
> *"The east is ready and the north will be within a day or two"*
> *"We must focus on Xos"*
> *"A third of us will allow us to make an adjustment."*
> *"We will put one of the remaining sisters on it"*
> *"Send both!"*
> *"No one must stay here - we cannot let the agents of the dragon know one of their kin is replaced."*
> *"Very well. But if they fail?"*
> *"We can still take those in the sea but the Githzeri are more experienced. Xos is simpler."*
> *"How is the vessel?"*
> *"All mine. She put up a fight for a while. It was adorable seeing her struggle but I don't think there is anything left to fight now."*

After hearing this Adrik goes on the attack, briefly surprising Control/Vasta, who quickly recovers and then the battle is joined.
