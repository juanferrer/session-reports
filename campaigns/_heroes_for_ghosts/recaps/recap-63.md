**Start Date**: 13th Rhaan (Late Afternoon)

Finally got a lead on that locket I found back during the war, a jeweller in Wroat said he worked on the same sorta one that a woman had purchased from a jeweller in Flamekeep. I got the address, and will follow it up next time we're in Thrane. 

We hung out at the Crag palace while C did her diplomacy. The witches addressed her as Emily d'Medani, I wonder if that's actually her real name? Anyways, I guess it went well, as she turned herself into the Queen after exiting the throne room. We didn't get to see what went on, the Daughters were a bit wise to us on that front, but we're pretty confident it is still Control that came out.

On our way back to drop off C, Elora started yelling for Toquill, and lo and behold, apparently Elora has a direct line as he asked to meet us in the cargo hold. Somehow our cargo hold had turned into a jazz club, and we met the dragon ruling council. They call themselves The Chamber. 

I think they musta been a bit worried we might take the witches up on the assassination thing, as they went out of their way to explain why they have the right of it. Apparently Prophecy is sort of instructions for building a world, and I think they want to break it (the prophecy, not the world… although I'm not too certain on that point!). They reckon our world is stagnating and there's some corruption in Xoriat that we need to fix. The plane of madness apparently used to be the plane of thought, and the Lords of Dust live there, although I don't think they're from there originally. I guess we could try banishing them as an experiment to confirm that.

We found a recurring number in the Prophecy/instructions for the jazz club and put it in our Epidiascope when we got back, and now we got a bunch more prophecies that don't make that much more sense than the first bunch.

We called into Sharn to drop C off, and I spent a day making an air fork while the rest of our party went to investigate the airship crash. I don't think they found out much conclusive.

We headed back to Making, where it seems Sachem has managed to reactivate the warforged colossus. His name is Noor. He doesn't say much. Apparently it works better with a driver, I have days like that too. We're a bit worried that all hell don't break loose with that colossus while we're gone, so since we got a direct line to a Queen now, we put Sachem in touch with her to negotiate for… whatever it is that he wants.

Then we installed the sphere of annihilation, took the airship up as far as it would go, and then we blasted into space on the rocket! It was quite a sensation, but I wish I had gone to the bathroom before we took off.
