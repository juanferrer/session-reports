**Start Date**: 20th Barrakas (Midday)

Standing in the now quiet Henge the party started investigating the ancient site. Varhoe translated the runes flashing across the slab in the centre.

- Kythri Coterminous
- Dal Quor Isolated
- Xorait Waxing / Waning / Coterminous / Isolated / Error 13

They realised the thirteen trilithons, monoliths and pools were connected with the planes and moons. Abel recalled how the planes wax in and wane out of being coterminous (occupying the same space). Planes that were coterminous had a greater effect on Eberron - with Kythri coterminous, storms were more likely. They reasoned the full pool was probably Kythir and the empty one Dal Quor. Dal Quor was the plane of dreams, the plane from which the Quori had invaded and caused the prolonged war with the giants of Xen'drik. Toquill had explained how the giants had separated Dal Quor from Eberron, meaning it could no longer become coterminous and the Dal Quor could no longer invade. Millenia later the Orc druids of Khorvaire had attempted the same thing with Xorait (plane of madness); this time without the Dragons aid and with mixed success. Tens of thousands of years after builders of Henge had died and its use forgotten, this machine seemed to be showing that unstable break. Abel pondered if Xorait was not always the plane of Madness.

Able tried putting a hand in one of the magical pools and received a buff to elemental spell casting. Some of group carefully started to experiment with the other pools; while E-Rex stuck her snout in the pool of swirling ethereal eyes and became incapacitated with hysterically laughter. They found the empty pool gave no effect while the others offered some sort of magical boost. Adrik tried out the pool connected with Kythri (The Storm) and while it did not do anything to his armour he did realise that with Kythri being coterminous he could activate another of its abilities. Before leaving the rest of the site was plundered for valuables.

After a few hours hiking down the tunnels to Amber the group made camp. Abel helped Adrik activate the Thunderstep aspect of his armour with RIP making him vulnerable to the damage while also healing him. Tish and Adrik watched some 'I'm a Dragon-Marked heir get me out of here' on Scry One and had a chat about the dangers ahead.

Arriving at Amber they found it locked but quickly deciphered the password for the security station, thanks to a sticky note left on the monitor. While hacking the station she also managed to print out a massive giant ID card that they figured might go with their "four humanoids in a giant coat" disguise.

The first laboratory was full of strange machinery. While the wizard tried to read the research notes, Adrik and Elora did some practical experimentation with the booths and found they swapped the sizes of anything placed within! While Adrik was enjoying being 5'9", Elora was less keen on being a foot and a half shorter with shoulders that would make any of her outfits look wrong. While they swapped back Varhoe and Pan swapped sizes and they experimented with inanimate objects. The Sybaris meteor was enlarged to the size of the ID card and broken down into pieces small enough to fit in Trunkie and RIP tried enlarging a healing potion and splitting it off a vial.

Moving on they found a room with a couple of old films and some models of ziggurats and monoliths. The film on Void Spheres described the process the giants used to make then and their uses in destroying Quori technology. The film about the ziggurats was harder to follow but seemed to show they were originally Giant tech and were used to manipulate the alignment of planes.

The second lab contained a machine similar to the first but the console indicated it was for "Conscious Transposition". After some debate RIP and Elora tried it out and found each was moved to the other's body. RIP found the sensation of breathing quite troublesome and got to experience the flavour of food for the first time. He tried some of the leftover sugared shrimp and decided he quite liked it. Elora was less keen on remaining an androgynous Warforged and they quickly changed back. They considered what would happen if creatures were swapped with inanimate objects but decided to perhaps try that later…

The third lab housed three large devices, two of which contained giants! One was nothing more than a skeleton but the other was preserved. Elora read off the numbers on the console and figured it was counting time; forty thousand, one hundred and seventy six years, four months, twelve days, eleven hours, forty six minutes and counting… the party debated the ethics of reviving a giant who had been frozen since before the destruction of the continent and the wisdom given the dragons had gone to considerable lengths to wipe out that civilization. But curiosity won and they started the revivification.

The revived giant was disorientated but able to communicate with Elora in elvish. He assumed she was one of their slave elves and that RIP was one of their maintenance bots. Abel and Adrik were a mystery to him, as he appeared to have not seen a gnome or dwarf before. Elora broke the news to him that "everyone's dead" (Dave). The storm giant introduced himself as Sludnar (aparently an eminent scientist). He had apparently hid in the cryo chamber when he heard the dragons that had been attacking the continent were heading towards the Amber facility. While still coming to terms with his situation the party asked him how the Void Sphere machines worked and got him to unlock the floor above.

The two drow operating the first void sphere charging machine were extremely surprised to see the party enter the room from the previously sealed floor below. A brief battle resulted in one of them being quickly killed while the other was captured. The captive drow said the matrons were on the top floor, questioning some "rock grubbers" and the party decided to hasten their progress. RIP dragged the prisoner down to the size swap device and miniaturised him before tying him onto his waist. Abel made him promise he'd feed and clean up after his new pet.

Rushing onto the next chamber the group discovered a hole to the outside and a very large drow encampment. Noticing the hole had been made with a portable hole they quickly collapsed it and stowed the device. The Scry Phone rang and Toquill reiterated the rules about inter-dimensional space and spheres of annihilation:
1. The carry case allows one to be physically moved without the arcana mind control checks but does not negate the dimensional restrictions
2. They must not be put in bags of holding
3. They must not be put in portable holes
4. They must not be put in pocket dimensions, including but not limited to rope tricks or magnificent mansions
5. They must not be taken through planar gates (like those generated by the Cubic Gate)
6. They can be safely teleported
7. They can be moved with a DC25 arcana check if within 60ft

As they came to the final sphere charging machines another drow ran into the party. He barely had time to turn before being cut down by a shot from Elora and our heroes made it to the elevator that would take them to the top floor. With the sounds of torture coming from above they ascended. The scene confronting them was: the two of changelings Sisters with a Sphere of Annihilation, torturing Adrik's father and his miniaturised mother being questioned by the third Sister…
