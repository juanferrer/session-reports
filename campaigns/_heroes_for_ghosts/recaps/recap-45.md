**Start Date**: 10th Barrakas (Evening)
 
As our heroes headed back to their arena changing room, Abel spotted the devil Hasanas sitting in the audience, the rest of the onlookers apparently oblivious to his presence. He reported he'd delivered her message to Ammeron, though it had been more difficult than he had expected.
 
Varhoe announced he'd found a ship that could take them to the Indigo site, indicated by the encrypted text on Magrus's grave. He negotiated a five gold per day fee for his guiding services and was officially hired by the party and the group retired to the One Good Tern for the evening.
 
In the morning the party met with the dragon-marked skipper of the Maelstrom (Cpt. Ty d'Lyrandar) who was happy to take on the charter for the voyage round to the Hydra river. Eight hundred gold was handed over to cover the five days sailing, plus six days waiting time to see if they would want a return or onward trip. It was agreed the captain would anchor in the river and wait up to six days for a sending from RIP. Further fees could be arranged to be deducted from their Kundarak accounts.
 
Some final shopping was done in preparation for the voyage. Elora finished off her book on The Natural History of Khorvaire (and became proficient in the nature skill). Adrik purchased a poisoners kit along with the Extermination for Dummies book and set about learning that skill. RIP decided to spice up his nutritional paste recipes with a selection of spices.
 
The next day, as the ship set sail, Varhoe evicted Pan from his cabin and insisted he be left alone throughout the voyage. The dejected Pan explained he'd been trying to get the guide interested in his re-enactment group, the Lhazaar Regalport Pirates Association, but found the party were all too happy to get involved. They filled in their membership forms and were provided with pirate costumes by the gnome, who went on to spout pirate facts for the rest of the day. Elora managed to recruit a few crew, including one whose father had been killed by pirates but figured it might be good therapy. The party's suspicions of their guide's reasons for being left alone were not allayed by claims he was scared of water.
 
Abel went to check out the twin Nackle & Hugrin mephit engines, powering the ship. Casting comprehend language she attempted to communicate with the pintsized elementals and was distressed to learn they had been plucked from their home in Kythri and while they didn't seem to mind working in the engine they did want to return home. She talked about her concerns with Elora and Adrik who were understanding but worried about alienating another dragon marked house if they freed them. Elora unsuccessfully tried to cast modify memory on Abel, who scolded the elf saying "losing one's memory was the worst thing that could happen to a person of her age".
 
After several hours a skiff was spotted and two adrift crew rescued (Al Whitford and Jay Midson). Jay was unconscious but Al described how their boat had sunk after being attacked by a giant sea monster. He thought Jay had taken a blow to the head but RIP was unable to bring him to consciousness and Abel detected a magical effect on him. Elora tried detect thoughts on Jay but was alarmed to find he had none whatsoever. The captain ordered watches doubled and the party assisted while Al and Jay were taken below decks.
 
All seemed quiet for a few hours, with no sign of any sea monsters, until a scuffle was heard from below decks and the engines cut out. The party rushed to investigate. To their horror they found the engineer dead, bitten in two with a half-shark half-man standing over him. Seeing the party it muttered "Kin eater! The consumers must pay". Adrik briefly felt vindicated saying "See, I told you merfolk were fish on top!" before realising they seemed to be after those who had consumed the flesh of their kind.
 
With more commotion coming from outside, RIP rushed on deck to see four more merfolk riding giant crabs, attacking the ship. Two of the fish people started singing an alluring song and half the crew started making their way up to the top deck. Abel yelled at those still in control of their faculties to stay in the cabin and followed RIP. The Elora dimension doored to the crow's nest and left Adrik to carve up the shark in the engine room.
 
On deck RIP was unable to stop several charmed crew jumping overboard but did manage to push the two merfolk warriors back into the sea with his antilife shell. Abel made it on deck in time to see the charmed Pan dive overboard. Coordinating with Elora, she cast feather fall on the elf and she jumped after Pan, who came to his senses just as one of the merfolk reached out for him. Elora quickly polymorphed him into a giant shark and urged him to attack the crab. Abel let fly with some fireballs from the Lingenhall Siege Wand as RIP healed and then banished the captain to keep him safe. Adrik fished off the warrior in the engine room and dashed on deck in time to help fend off the merfolk who had climbed back on the ship.
 
With the two crabs and three merfolk dead the rest decided to flee. The ship had suffered some serious damage, five crew had been killed but the officers, the party and Pan were safe.

**Viewers**:
- 11th Barrakas no show.
- 12th Barrakas still filming but the only footage of the attack was a few mind controlled crew shuffling past the door to Pan's cabin as the cameraman had abandoned his scrycam when he was charmed.
