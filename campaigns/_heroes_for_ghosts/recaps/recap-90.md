**Start Date**:  11th Olarune (7am)

Returning to Deep Ward we quickly realise the anti-magic defences are going to make things difficult, so we turn them off again. Elora grapples the werewolf thing with Bigby's Hand. Adrik hits it a few times and RIP uses his anti-life shell to pin it down. Abel casts arcane gate behind it and Elora fears it into the gate. It pops out the other side into its hold monster field prison. Very neatly done!

We go check out the obelisk room. The crystals are lit, and seem to be either inhabited, or maybe grant a viewing portal, of the imprisoned Daelkyr. Two of the crystals are dark. RIP uses Lore to learn that the place was made by the gatekeepers and was part of the war against the outsiders. Adrik manages to prevent Elora from licking the obelisk.  We also try using speak with dead to question the dead Governor. He gives us the dates that the two crystals went out (10 Ollarune 96 and 13 Rhaan 98). The 13 Rhaan date coincides with Control's transformation.  10 Ollarune was 10 days before the Treaty of Thornhold. Rotdur later confirms that the first crystal to go out on 10 Ollarune was Quillion's.

Returning to the surface it  finally seems like we did something to make Rotdur happy. He invites us for lunch and shows us the missing hand of one of his men who was foolish enough to touch the obelisk. Elora flirts her way into a tour of the Vault, with Abel tagging along (much to Rotdur's dismay). We film some stuff and do some interviews for the documentary, and along the way get to talk to Ermin. As we know he's been in contact with Quillion, Adrik makes notes of his ravings, hoping to find some important clue: The sixth indivisible (sixth prime, 13) in its justified position is the key that's needed to line them up. The boxes? He means the Daelkyr. He said the boxes are not the point, but what's outside the box. The outsiders. They will come to get it. Then he took his pants off and ran off.

We say our farewells and take the airship back to Krona peak, where Adrik picks up his new amulet.  Kaerra (the blacksmith) says the fernyxium would be best used for armor and that it could be enchanted in a fraction of the usual time. I think maybe Adrik wants to revisit Fernia. But for now, we are headed for The Twilight Demesne to hopefully attune a planar rod so we can send Scarlet home, then we need to pay the Daughters of Sora Kell a visit.
