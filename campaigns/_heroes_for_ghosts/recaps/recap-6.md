**Start Date**: 14th Dravago (nearly midnight)

The second day's sailing passed without much incident. Elora interrogated the captain about his lost lover and the crew took part in a gun drill - during which the Party learned how to operate a cannon. 

In the early hours of the 16th a stowaway was found that turned out to be the same beggar the party saw on the quayside in Sharn. The stowaway had removed the amber crystal from the magical device in the captains quarters and was grinding it into the dust form he used for snorting. Unfortunately the crystal seemed to be powering the device that was keeping some exotic animals petrified in the ships hold. Within a few minutes a deadly Banderhobb had smashed its way out of its crate and killed a number of crew before the party could intervene. The giant toad-like creature consumed the captain - though Adrik was able to pull Greenbottle from the animals stomach once it was slain.

Realising there were three other giant creatures being smuggled in this petrified form the party leapt into action with Able levitating an owlbear out of the cargo hatch and into the sea; while Adrik, RIP and Elora smashed a giant snake and crocodile before they could become animate. 

The incident had killed or incapacitated all of the officers so the Party took over command of the ship; Elora taking up the role of First Mate, Able as Quartermaster, Adrik as Bosun and RIP as doctor/cook (a worrying combination). A decision was made to run the ship on two shifts and lay anchor overnight.

An attempt was made to interrogate the stowaway, resulting in RIP attempting to remove the man's arm - as a spare part for the sailor who had lost his own. Adrik was able to intervene, much to the relief of the on looking crew. It became apparent the prisoner did not had the mental faculty to provide useful information. Able attempted to discuss the morality of removing eyes and limbs from the living - with RIP in turn able to give perfectly logical reason why it was the correct course of action.

With their debate on involuntary organ donation coming to a close a lookout reported "ships ahoy". Upon investigation it looked to be another galleon alongside a smaller sloop. Seaman Canen explained they were Cyrian reavers - former cyrian navy who were still fighting the war years after the Mourning event destroyed their country. He explained they tended to waylay passing vessels looking for Brelanders, Zilargans or Darguun who they would capture and often torture before killing. To the delight of the crew the Party decided to intervene. The ship was set on a course to deliver a broadside of chainshot to the Queen Dannel's sails before looping round for another volley and inserting The Castle between the enemy galleon and the stricken sloop. 

Boarding the Cyrian vessel the Party fought their way through a number of swashbucklers while RIP worked on saving the crew of the burning sloop. Elora distracted the captain with an illusion of him being on fire, while also attempting to make use of the jury-rigged explosive crossbow bolt and accidently setting fire to the mainsail. The confidence gained by early successes stuttered when one of the swashbucklers nearly killed Ableâ€¦ who only escaped because she had foreseen the event with her portent. Far from safe Able nearly fell to the Firstmate's inflict wounds spell, before her and Adrick were able to finish them off with his battleaxe and her dragon breath!

During this time RIP had managed to free two of the prisoners before calling for the crew to lower a cargo net alongside the ship for the remaining goblins to be thrown into - preventing their heavy chains drowning them (RIP gets DM inspiration for his efforts).

The party retreated to The Castle taking The Queen Dannel's crew with them along with the bound captain and some loot from his cabin. 

**End Date**: 17th Dravago (late afternoon)

**Loot**: One locked chest, two silver goblets and a painting of 'The Cathedral on the Hill' (Metrol - Cyre).
Plus fifteen sailors from The Queen Dannel and four sailors from Picotee (sloop).
