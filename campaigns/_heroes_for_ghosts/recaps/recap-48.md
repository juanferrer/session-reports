**Start Date**: 19th Barrakas (Morning)

After finishing off the back-talking drow prisoner the party set about searching the rooms they had cleared. Abel investigated the huge black pillar by licking it! It tasted of conjuration and evocation with a hint of abjuration. She realised it appeared to be made of the same material as the obelisk and perhaps should not be licked! Abel concluded it was probably part of an arcane machine but its function she could not fathom.


Elora opened up a set of doors to a large room where a gangway, long in disrepair, traversed a pool of water. Various members of the party noted the inflow of warm water from pipes below the surface, outflow pipes draining it off and tide marks that indicated the level was sometimes much higher. Deeply suspicious of what might lie within they elected for RIP to cast water walking on the party. As expected once the door through which they entered closed the water level started to rise rapidly!

With the party making it to the opposing door Abel tried to misty step down to the control panel, but was immediately shot back out by the hydrophobic water walk. As the gnome arced high above the group RIP dropped the spell to give her a soft landing and the party dropped into the water. Suddenly an invisible force began to attack the party. RIP managed to reach the door control but found some kind of safety lock had engaged and it would not open. Adrik cast shatter to briefly outline the creature and reveal its location as Abel used Knock to override the door lock and pushed the button again.

A torrent of water washed the party and the elemental into the next room, sloshing across the floor. They just had time to see the creature instantly killed by the electrical discharge they too were being swept towards. Elora cast Wall of Force… stopping them abruptly just before disaster. The elf used the same spell again to great effect in creating a safe tunnel for them to walk through the electric field. Wanting to capture the moment for the audience they sent Pan on to film them smoothly walking through the tunnel… but put on the spot with the forced performance RIP could not stop staring and the camera and Abel's attempt at lighting a cigarette resulted in a coughing fit. Perhaps they'll just cut it to Elora's solid performance?

Reaching another stairwell the group decided they needed a breather and tucked themselves into an alcove for a rest before continuing. 

Hearing voices from above the party carefully made their way up with RIP scouting with his eye familiar. The vast 300ft room contained more arcane machinery. Four pylons aimed at an inverted, floating, black pyramid that pointed down to the top of the black pillar seen from the floor below. A half dozen dead drow lay at the feet of another Adrik who was freeing a bound Lacey Omaren! On seeing the party the other Adrik called out and accused their Adrik of being an imposter! Our Adrik denied this, but the rest of the party looked at him suspiciously. Fadrik claimed he had been captured by drow when they fled Dark Leap a couple of weeks ago and explained the lack of the phase axe as the Drow had taken it. Adrik demanded they should be able to recall the axe if it were theirs. Fadrik could not do this and, concerned about seeing them about to leave the antimagic field by the door, decided the game was up.

Fadrik transformed and took the appearance of a female Drow matriarch. They monologued "It's been such a chore not killing you already. But we don't need you anymore. We already have one of the Tools and soon with have the rest. And this one (gesturing at Lacey) has not been very helpful. Torafin, finish this one and then kill the rest". Their lieutenant teleported next to Lacy, killing her with a thunderous discharge. The party rushed forward and the Fadrik / Drow / ??? entity disappeared.

Dozens more drow came out of hiding and an epic battle commenced. Fortunately RIP swung the fight in the parties favour by banishing the power armour wearing Torafin until the rest had been dealt with. Returned from banishment, Torafin proved quite deadly even on his own. He unleashed a chain lighting that badly injured Elora and Adrik and knocked RIP unconscious! Hoping to use the downed cleric as a distraction in which to make his escape he tried to make it to the stairs but Elora and Adrik pursued and finished him.

Adrik revived RIP and the party began taking in what was left of the battlefield. A dazed and confused Lacey started to describe what had happened to her when a voice familiar to Adrik called out "Very slowly drop your weapons and raise your hands or the gnome gets it!" Turning, a woman that looked and sounded like Tishnar Caebrek had Pan in a headlock with a wand pointed at his temple!
