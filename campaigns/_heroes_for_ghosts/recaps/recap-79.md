**Start Date**: 25th Zarantry (Morning)

Shanserran gives us some shiny shackles to stop any divination magic working on Mahari. Also a compass, which points to "home" - in this case meaning the fey spire. If there's a piece of the fey spire in Fernia, the compass may point to it. Adrik and RIP propose disposing of Mahari once and for all. We all have a bit of a moral squirm with that, but decide it might be for the best. Elora attempts to read Mahari's mind, but Mahari resists. Sora Katra calls us and says they've changed their mind about the whole releasing the Daelkyr thing, and we should go ahead and kill Mahari. Which we do, in front of the ScryPhone camera so Sora Katra can witness. (Adrik later made a comment about us doing snuff films…) Sora Katra also tells us that Vasster is under Droaam, and that it may be possible to destroy the Quillon by defeating him on the Plane of Madness. We head to Flamekeep to do some shopping.

Elora buys a paper. News:
- Karnath forces building on border of Talenta Plains
- Breeland declared month of mourning for loss of Prince Oargev
- King Boranel's health is deteriorating
- Wroat are calling for Breeland to become a republic

We do some shopping, and then head to Silver Flame Cathedral to try to get their teleportation circle. We meet an adorable little girl, who Adrik realises is Jaela Darren, the Keeper of the Flame (basically the Pope), but she takes us to the teleport circle.

We head to Fernia, City of Brass! And immediately make friends, as RIP spills a fire dwarf's brew. They punch Elora (because who wouldn't?!) and then settle down to help Abel polish off a bottle of whisky. Free booze is always a great way to make friends with the locals, and after some casual prompting the fire dwarves tell us that elementals are causing more trouble than usual, and that we might learn more from the Matsara (Djinn). They are the equivalent of the police in the City of Brass. Checking the Fey Compass, we see it is pointing to the south-east. Our new friends tell us in that direction lie Plume, Margate and Cindersweeps (these seem to be sectors or neighbourhoods of the city).

Adrik just wanders up to the po-po and asks about trouble with elementals. Being as how it's Adrik asking, the policeman is unexpectedly helpful and explains that the unrest coming from industrial wastes outside the city in a place called Fen'iks Tashkil, 2-3 miles outside the city wall. This place is owned by a powerful Efrati called Kifu, who is making a fortune selling armour made of some new material called Fernyxium (working with humans from Eberron). The facility is off limits to the Matsara. The Matsara gives us some travel documents indicating we are in the City of Brass for trading and commerce. We immediately head out into the searing heat, making plans as we travel to potentially pose as investors or re-sellers. The fact that we have a celebrated blacksmith with our party might also grease the wheels somewhat.
