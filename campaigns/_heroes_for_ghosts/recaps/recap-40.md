With the cultists dead the party searched the main temple chamber and spoke more to Varhoe. The big bear of a man asked them to remove the slave collar that had been chafing his neck while telling them there would be lots more drow in the temple and jungle outside but they did not like the sunlight and were more likely to attack at night. Adrik attempted to cover up the portal door with foliage before realising it would be hopeless. The group considered going back to Metrol to rest but were concerned they would return to find more drow in the main chamber and so decided to press on. They took the runes from the vault door letting it close.
 
Abel started to meditate to use her arcane eye pillow but had not finished when footsteps were heard and a cry of alarm coming from the passage where the drow priestesses body had been left. Quickly they went for the main door. Finding themselves in a wide hallway with doors in all directions they continued on straight, closing the doors behind them. E-Rex nudged open the next doors and charged at a solo guard, falling into a concealed pit trap. 
 
As the guard cast darkness and tried to make a run for help, the blinded E-Rex sniffed out his 'fear', bit and tail swiped him into a stain on the wall. By now, the drow investigating the horrific scene of their friends murder, opened the door to the corridor the party was in, but were held back by Adrik's cloud of daggers.
 
The party retreated to the now open external doors, with Adrik and RIP bringing up the rear, mindful of turning their back on the dark elf wizards. It became clear more and more of the drow were coming to investigate the disturbance, but our heroes finally made it outside. Adrik closed the doors behind him and Abel stone shaped some bars to keep them closed. After putting to sleep and then setting fire to some hapless drow, the bridge was clear and everyone made it across. RIP tried to set a trap to weaken the bridge but was a little too enthusiastic with the knife and left it hanging by a thread.
 
During a short rest in the rope trick Varhoe got out his map and showed them they were about four days walk from Stormreach. He recommended traveling at night and resting by day when they were less likely to be ambushed by drow. But after considering the other danger the jungle might contain the party elected to camp at night using the dome for protection.
 
Over the next few days…
- Abel catalogued some weird local wildlife
- They met Irk (a lizardfolk alchemist) who sold them some potions
- Elora made friends with some monkeys - whose behaviour turned a bit shitty when their free food was cut off
- They found several safe places to camp
 
On the third night the group accidently setup camp in the sleeping site of a tiger. But by the time the group rose from sleep Elora had charmed the beast and named it Sebastian. The bard had it follow her for a few hours before eventually (tearfully) having to leave it behind.
 
While preparing to camp for the final time before Stormreach our heroes were jumped by a large group of drow. A chase ensued that nearly led to their capture before one was banished by RIP, another commanded to look for his sword and third pinned with Elora's Reap and Sew crossbow. The group made their getaway and after a final night made it to Stormreach…
