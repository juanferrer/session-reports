**Start Date**: 5th Nymm (late afternoon)

As we re-joined the story the party asked Elora about why her uncle called her Theeala; Elora confessed that Theeala was her given name and that Elora was an identity she took when she was sent to spy on Breeland during the war. She explained to her parents we both high up in the Cyrian military, her mother a member of the Queen's Guard and her father in Cyrian military intelligence. She expressed regret about the people who had died because of the information she provided. The news was taken a little hard by Adrik but Able seemed like she could relate given her own relationship with The Trust. 

Adrik confessed his real name was Adrik Caebrek, but declined to say why he had changed it - saying it was "a story for another day".

The party set out to make enquiries at the House Jorasco office about the resettlement programme Meriele had joined. They learned she had left New Cyre three weeks ago and would by now have reached Gatherhold. The clerk suggested the local office in Gatherhold would have more information on where settlers had moved to once on The Plains.

The party booked passage to Gatherhold at the House Orien Travel Office. For 86g each they secured passage via coach, lightning rail and airship on a journey they would take 10 days.

Upon leaving the office a couple of dragons were seen fighting above a park full of children. On closer inspection they turned out to be an illusion cast by non-other than Toquill as "an entertaining and educational show depicting the creation of Eberron". He had apparently travelled catch up with the party as they had not reported on their progress since leaving Sharn. He was particularly interested in the information on the Astral Sea and suggested they visit The Great Library in Flamekeep on their way to Gatherhold - but he warned the Keeper was a cantankerous old sod.

Uncle Keafir informed Elora that King Oargev Wynarn wanted to see her first thing in the morning. She elected to stay with him that evening, while the rest of the party headed to the Come On Inn for food drinks and a bed. Another adventuring party was in the tavern spreading around a share of their recent good fortune - as they had apparently collected on the bounty for the bandit warforged Conductor 77. The party looked up Conductor 77 on their bounty list and noted the whopping 8k reward. As one of the hobgoblin members of the party got increasingly drunk she let slip they had a much better paying job planned... retrieving a cache of magical artefacts from an abandoned mine on the northern road.

The party now quiet drunk from the free drinks returned to Keafir's house to let Elora know about the top quality intelligence they had picked up on. Elora eagerly agreed they should go after the artefacts themselves and Keafir informed them that the Wailing Barrow mine was about a two days carriage journey north. 

In the morning Able put on her best blue ball gown (with Adrik’s help) as she said she'd never met a Prince before. The meeting was a little solemn, with the King thanking Elora for her service and the party for bravely going where his own men refused. He had little material help to offer but a map of Metrol was provided and information on the protocol involving how the royal family would be petrified in the catacombs of the Vemishard by Arch Mage Garrick Talandro. Able noted that they did not have access to the Greater Restoration spell needed to undo petrifaction.

After a quick shopping trip for basic supplies the party met their driver (Peramin) who agreed they could make camp on the second night near The Wailing Barrow mine. The journey there was uneventful and upon arrival they checked for signs of recent activity but only found week old tracks. Carefully making their way inside they soon reached the obstacle of a broken bridge - which Elora managed to cross on her 5th attempt after much help from the rest of the party!

At the bottom of the surprisingly small mine they discovered a fake zombie and found themselves surrounded by the adventures who had been buying them drinks a few nights prior. The leader demanded they hand over "The Murder RIP" who she claimed had killed in cold blood her husband in Groshk. The bugbear warlock insisted her husband had no knowledge of what Chief Grish had been doing and was murdered by RIP after surrendering to the party. When it was clear they were not about to hand over the warforged a fierce battle ensued. Evard's Black Tentacles and a fireball nearly incapacitated most of the party - only saved by Elora's cutting words. The Warlock successfully levitated RIP into the air - intent on dropping him from a great height - and it was for a while looking bleak for the party… 

They eventually did pull it back however, killing the wizard and warlock. The fighter offered to surrender on the condition they kept RIP away from her! RIP at first refused, but as Able washed her hands of the situation (and refused to fight against opponents who had asked for mercy) Adrik joined her and tackled RIP. RIP eventually conceded and offered to save one of the slain - Ketareel asked him to save Gibin (the wizard) as Zargung would just come after him again if she was brought back.

As RIP cast Gentle Repose on Gibin, the party looted the corpses and returned to their camp.
