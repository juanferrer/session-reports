As the Overseer attempted and failed to end the blindness spell cast upon him, Adrik quite literally leapt into battle. He vaulted the balcony wall catching hold of one of the beholders eye stalks. Riding and hacking the aberration while his comrades pelted it with spells. Elora produced one of the de-petrifaction vials and tempted the Overseer to a brief cessation of hostilities - before the group once again opened up on it. Tragically never regaining its sight the final blow was dealt against the archmage by Elora's lightning bolt and his ruined body started to fall hundreds of feet down the centre of the tower. Realising he did not have time to activate the feather fall pack it looked like Adrik was going to suffer serious injury, when Abel managed to react and cast the spell on him. 
 
Abel went to investigate the strange device that Lysee had drawn her attention too at the start of the fight. Learning it had text floating round it written in draconic she started the ritual of comprehend language while the others inspected the petrified guard. It became clear identifying Elora's mother would not be easy as all the Queen's Guard were in full plate armour. Adrik used his knowledge of blacksmithing to help eliminate some of the possibilities. The group discussed what to do with the queen given her questionable morals; and the probability whichever guards they revived would probably insist on saving the Queen.
 
With comprehend languages complete, Able translated the text. The party believed they were about them or events they had been or will be involved in. They dubbed them prophecies. They noticed the device had thirteen rings each containing thirteen numbers and tried inputting the two codes from Dha'iteag. They seemed to refer to the spheres of annihilation being lost in the vault.
 
With the prophecy referring to ghosts of the last war returning from the eye of the storm particularly troubling the group Elora suggested dropping her off the balcony (on live Scry TV) as a symbol of her rejecting the Queen and Cyre. Abel petitioned for a more subtle approach of using stone shape to stir up her brain before de-petrification. In the end a compromise was made and they decided to gravely injure the Queen (with a stomach wound) and inflict some minor injuries on the other Queen's guard.
 
Knight Commander Hagen Bacher was first to be de-petrified. He recognised Thaila and was able to point out Shava to her. A strained reunion played out with Elora's mum re-lived to see her daughter but distraught at the loss of her nation and the state of the queen.
 
The group made a quick inspection of the telescope but it currently being daylight were unable to see what it was trained on and decided to check again later that night.
 
The party took a break to heal up and identify the items they had found. RIP took particular interest in an eyeball that seemed to push back when he attempted to attune. Trying a second time he let its mental probing in and became overcome with the urge to replace one of his own eyes with the object! After seeing this horror play out the rest of the party examined him and noticed the spot on his neck had grown again - now resembling a small dragon mark! Pan suggested he kept it covered - warning the Houses would likely take action against an individual with a new dragon mark. Elora knitted him a scarf to cover it but RIP refused to wear it.
 
Our heroes left the guard in the tower as they exited with their loot to deal with other tasks in the city - promising to return the next day with transport for the still statuesque monarch. 
 
Back at the bank the rune stones were inserted into the North east vault and it opened up to reveal a prototype single person air vehicle, the Cannith Broom. Elora immediately leapt on and flew it out the bank while Pan received a sending from Lysee requesting they pretend they found it elsewhere so as not to incriminate themselves or House Sivis in the bank raid. The party set up a scene outside where Elora (?) prayed for the gods to send them aid while muttering the command word used to recall the Broom. Elora's 30 performance was outstanding but we will have to see how the zeros from RIP and Adrik played out to the audience.
 
Returning to the Lightning Rail station, Twenty Two thanked them for their service in killing the Overseer. She explained about the battle at the Palace of Spirit and the losses they had suffered there. RIP spent some time tending to wounded Reforged. As our Warforged cleric approached the static Lightning Rail train the vehicle suddenly came to life. The party rushed over along with most of the warforged. It was assumed RIPs new mark had caused it to activate. A quick test was done with him moving away from the train and returning - it only powered up when he was near. Our cleric was left a bit overwhelmed by this development. It seemed like he was unsure he wanted the mark or the attention it was bringing.
