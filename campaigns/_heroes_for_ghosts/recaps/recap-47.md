**Start Date**: 18th Barrakas (Morning)

With the sound of approaching giants our heroes hid to take stock of the situation. Varhoe translated the giant's apparent intention of going after the ship and the party agreed they needed to intercept them. A plan was quickly hatched and Adrik stepped out to greet the giants and ask to be taken to their great queen Big Mama Orden. Abel and RIP contributed with some spells to simulate there being lots of people in the bushes, which proved to be a problem when the Giants agreed to Adrik's proposal but wanted everyone to come out. A fight eventually broke out and giant Rot was killed. Sog was persuaded to still take them back to his village and possibly make a bid for leadership or the party… or something… Elora further confused Sog into thinking Rot had just bumped his head and he'd not been able to wake him up.

A couple of hour's walk later the party arrived at the giant's settlement of Daug Holla, a filthy, stinking pit that led into a ruin beneath the hillside. Having abandoned the plan to try and take over the clan they went for the simpler option of bribing the giants with food. RIP produced fifty pounds of bear meat (to Varhoe's horror) for the giants to chew down on. Their guide helped negotiate permission to explore the ruins but cautioned the chief now wanted to keep RIP as a pet. 

In one of the rooms at the back of the ruin the party found what looked like a dimensional portal. Through some risky experimentation a finger and then Elora's head were inserted into the portal with no ill effects other than the elf vomiting after realising she had just stuck her head into what seemed to be a giant toilet. Unaffected by the stench RIP jumped into the pocket dimension to see if he could find anything but just got a "nugget".

Meanwhile Varhoe had spotted some runes on an arch behind the chief's throne with a riddle:

```
A look that isn't broken
A case that doesn't open
A landing when nothing flew
```

Abel correctly guessed the answer was stair and with that word the passage to a Khyber tunnel opened up…

The party made their way further below ground and discovered these Khyber tunnels seemed to be used as something like a giant subway, the name of this station being Deep Hollow. Though no subway trains seemed to be nearby they did find some platform signs that indicated the possible connections and set off to one they thought might be Indigo.

Following a nervous overnight camp in the tunnels the group did arrive at another station named Indigo Convergence. The other connections from here were closed off with some kind of magical barrier but as their immediate business was at the site above they ascended. The stairs from the station emerged into a series of vast chambers, this time thankfully without the Giant faeces stench. Abel checked out the door controls and found that a) they made a loud noise when operating and b) she could lock them with her tinker's tools. Thankfully the drow the party could hear off in the distance paid no attention to the door noise and they were able to scout out the area with RIP's eye. A group of Drow were inspecting a slab to the north and another group seemed to be camped to the east. RIP blocked off the eastern corridor with a silence spell so they could first take out the northern group.

With the first group of Drow dispatched they made quick note of the runes on the slab and Abel looted the remains of a spellbook off the researcher. RIP recast the silence spell by the entrance to the second group of Drow and the group prepared another surprise attack. This time the final dark elf was able to surrender. He was tied up (very poorly) by RIP and when questioned said they were there to guard the group exploring the ruin. And that the group was led by their Matron. The questioning had descended into insults by the point the Drow was able to wriggle free of his bindings and attempt to cast a spell. Elora countered it and RIP unleashed his newly acquired powerful necromancy spell, Harm while vowing to kill all the drow.

His blood up and wanting to fuck with some more Drow, the warforged sent a sending to the one who had been looking for his sword under Geas for the past fortnight, to say "I think I saw your friend with your sword heading to Greengate".
