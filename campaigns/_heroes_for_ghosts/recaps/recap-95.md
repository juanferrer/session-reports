**Start Date**:  2nd Therendor  (10am) **Now on Astral Time x10 Eberron** - Astral Date 131448

We continue the combat with Daddybrain and friends. We manage to take out the friends, but as we do Daddybrain manages to break Riman from its prison. For a moment all seems lost, until Elora wishes that didn't happen. Although the spell is a considerable drain on Elora, the Wish is successful and time reverses, keeping Riman contained. We manage to break into the casing protecting Daddybrain and disconnect it, killing it. RIP attempts to use Severance, but discovers there is no soul to absorb. RIP uses Sending to communicate with Elora's dad, but receives a rambling message back about stopping the lies.

We arrange rooms at the Astral Anchor Inn and spend the afternoon doing some shopping while Elora recuperates. Adrik finds an expert on the flora of Xoriat/Lharvion to speak to about his screaming mushroom root samples, who reassures him that the screaming was likely not real.  After a good night's rest and a little magical assistance Elora is feeling good as new, and we head back to Eberron to check on Control.

Sora Teresa shares some of the wilder conspiracy theories about the Queen's disappearance making the rounds of the gossip rags, and we find that Control has recovered and departed for Wroat.  We call her, but she remembers very little about her ordeal, just fragments of being in a padded cell and being taken for treatment, and some fellow inmates - one named Lindra who felt the need to mourn everyone who ever died, and another who collected invisible butterflies.

Seems it is time to travel to Xoriat and see if we can kill Xos and Vastur permanently.
