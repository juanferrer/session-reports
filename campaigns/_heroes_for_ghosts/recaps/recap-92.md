**Start Date**: 20th Olarune (8am) Day of Mourning

Continuing the fight with Control, or at this point Vastur really, some of the palace guards start paying attention to the commotion. Elora manages to impersonate Control and get rid of one, but another walking past the window sees four Scry stars murdering the Head of Breelish Intelligence and calls an alert. Despite being charmed by Vastur, Adrik manages to somewhat convince the guards that Control isn't really Control. Abel stops time and drops a desk on Control, squashing her dead. Time resumes, and RIP starts in on the guards until Abel sends them to the pub with mass suggestion. We take a purple everbright lantern, Vastur's hourglass, and a letter from the office. The letter is addressed to Salmon, and indicates that the Daelkyr may be able to "make an adjustment" to bring back Mahari. It would also seem Salmon is currently focussed on freeing Xos in Pelmaraine.

Leaving the palace, we witness a flaming meteor dropping on the city - heading for the impact site we discover the last missing Colossus laying waste to the market. After a brief argument about whether we should risk our main mission, Adrik uses his armour's ability to blink inside the Colossus head, Elora dimension doors herself and RIP in, and Abel joins them after narrowly avoiding getting stomped to death. RIP tries using his ultimate ability, create food and water, to fill the brain container with pumpkin soup, while Elora pushes random buttons and destroys some more of the city. Eventually Elora destroys the brain casing, and RIP finishes the colossus off with his scythe.

After the fight, we retire to the nearest inn (The Busty Barmaid) to discuss next steps. We message Toquil who informs us that we could get to Xoriat by finding a portal on the associated moon, Lharvion. Elora spends the night making it rain at the Busty Barmaid, while the rest of us have a more restful night at the nearby Merchant's Last Coin. The next day we head to the manor house to deal with whatever is impersonating Elora's mother. We are received by a butler, which Elora identifies as a changeling, and are shown into a sitting room. On checking the desk, we find a letter from Salmon to her sister, from which we infer Coteh is the one impersonating Shava.
