**Start Date**: 7th Olarune (6 am)

Our laundry basket ruse doesn't go well, and we end up fighting and killing another three guards. We hide their bodies in the bag of holding,  set a fire in the workshop, and hide on top of the elevator, except Iron who pretends to have accidentally started the fire. Amazingly, this ruse actually works.

Iron then starts a fight with one of the guards, who luckily manages to stun himself before things get too out of control. Removing the remains from the bag of holding and stashing them on top of the elevator, Krek and Apex then get in the bag of holding, and Iron takes a cart of burned wood with Zidor underneath, and we finally make it into Red Ward! We get into the shower block and meet Ratrop, who is Apex's old cellmate. He informs us that Diabra has a key to gold ward, and tags along with us in the hope of securing an escape.

We find some of Azraba's stash, and Krek suggests using it to blackmail Diabra. A guard comes along to lock down the cells, we kill him. When Diabra gets back we threaten to leave the corpse and drugs in her cell. She quickly gives up the key for gold ward.

Ratrop says he can give us an introduction to the Orcleone guy, and he will know what's going on in Gold Ward. We make it to the Orcleone "cell", which is more like a palace, and turns out Iron is buddy buddy with Skull Crusher who seems to be the bodyguard for Mr Zorg. Iron has a long discussion with Mr Zorg while his colleagues potentially suffocate in the bag of holding.

Mr Zorg wants Apex to fight, we try to bribe him with nice items. He informs us that there is (maybe!) a deep ward under Stone Ward, where the Prince is most likely being held. After giving up really too many of our shiny magic items, he gives us the location of two air vents - one going from gold to stone, and one (maybe!) from Stone to Deep.

The body count is currently at 10, and we have two key Tower key tokens (one confirmed to unlock Infirmary tower, unsure about any other Tower access), Red Ward, Stone Ward and Gold Ward.
