After checking with everyone, we entered the portal to meet Xos. We found ourselves in an old-fashioned theatre-operating room. We saw Xos at the centre of the room, next to a table, as he was "performing" (his words) on a fully-conscious patient, which turned out to be Cedric. He said he was creating art. He referred to the pain and suffering of the body and mind as a symphony and a beautiful thing to behold and experience. There were three other people tied to the walls, waiting for their turn on the operating table.

We had masks strapped on our faces, which were releasing some gas which made us slower. We ripped them off and went after Xos. That proved difficult, as we were constantly beset by confusion and madness. Adrik powered up with potions, but it was still a tough fight. At some point some spirits appeared after Elora killed two of the people being held. One of the spirits took control of Adrik, but RIP brought him back with Greater Restoration before he could do too much damage.

Elora used her Lightning Bolt, which split with wild magic and hit Xos, killing him. As usual, RIP used his Severance to scatter Xos' soul. Babel went a bit crazy and started attacking us, so we had to kill her. May she rest in peace.
