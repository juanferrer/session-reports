**Start Date**: 7th Olarune (11am)

Leaving Zorg's cell/palace we encounter a madman named Ermin rambling about boxes and outsiders coming to take him away. After a short conversation he takes his trousers off and runs away, creating a nice distraction for us to make it to the air vent. The vent is covered by a metal grate, but we improvise a welder using a torch and control flame. Krek opens the door into Stone ward a little too noisily, which results in us having to fight two guards. Zidor immolates one, the other surrenders and tells us that all the keys for Deep Ward are on Deep Ward. Then Zidor slits his throat.

Opening the door again, we see Magrus, captain of the guard, walk past with a prisoner. Figuring he might have some sort of master key, we follow and attack him. Despite his attempts to escape up the ventilation shaft, Apex shish-kebabs him. He has a black keycard. We release the prisoner Magrus just locked up, arm him and give him a spare key for Stone Ward so he can start a general prison-break/distraction. We make it to the next ventilation shaft, crack the grate and head down.

Unfortunately none of our keycards work to open the door out into Deep Ward, and after some debate on how to proceed, Ratdrop points out the obviousâ€¦ we can travel through the air vents. The first exit we find from the vent is into a security station. We pop out, mightily surprising the guard on duty. After Zidor sets him on fire he tries to hit the general alarm, but seems to have triggered some other button. Iron grapples the guard before he can push any more buttons, and Apex does a ninja somersault over the desk, his swords rippling into flame, before plunging them into the guard and finishing him. Now we have a key for Deep Ward.

We play with some of the buttons on the security station which unfortunately resulted in some eldritch beasts being released from containment. Cue blood, screaming, dying. Oops. Travelling through the vents again, we come across a room with some sort of magical apparatus. Zidor extracts the dragonshard which causes the machine to power down. The screaming gets louder. Further along the vents we pass a room with a creepy obelisk in it (what's all that about?!) and find a cell block which isn't full of abominations and dying guards. Just one guard holding the block door closed. He's so distracted by what's going on outside that he doesn't pay us much mind and when we start asking about a blonde prisoner he indicates one of the cells.

Freeing the prisoner from their restraints and mask, we discover not Prince Orgaev, but Shava Darkbrood. She tells us that she witnessed the Prince's murder at the hands of someone working for Control, and was imprisoned here to shut her up, as murdering her would have drawn Elora's wrath. We messaged Elora with this news, and she immediately dropped the spell, swapping the suicide squad out for the regular team. RIP teleported us to the graveyard in Stormreach. Sheva told us she and the Prince had suspicions about the Queen, particularly after Elora's cryptic message, and they managed to get hold of a Scroll of True Seeing by which they discovered the Queen had been replaced with a changeling. The Prince had a freakout about this discovery and someone named Koteth took care of him with Power Word Kill. During her captivity and transport to Dreadhold, Sheva also overheard that they are trying to bring the Plane of Madness to Eberron and that they are concerned about the possibility of the Daughters finding out and allying with us.

Final Dreadhold body count: 14 direct kills, and an unknown amount of guards eaten by monsters. Plus they're probably going to have to change all the locks now.
