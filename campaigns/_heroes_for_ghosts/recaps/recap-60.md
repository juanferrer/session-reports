**Start Date**: 5th Rhaan (Afternoon)

Greetings from Quarth Courth Karrnath!

So, we got settled into our airship and ordered a new figurehead. Judging by the current one, seems maybe this boat was meant for some House D’Jorasco muckety muck.

Speaking of House D’Jorasco, while we was out shopping I got some news that Brella has been starting an independent alchemy movement (supported by ingredients from the new settlements in Talenta Plains), and its getting pretty popular due to House D’Jorasco trying to push their legal fees on to the consumer. You go girl!

The protoforged seemed to be enjoying their discovery day, maybe a bit too much. We found one of em doing some exotic dancing, and making some pretty good money out of it. Its decided to name itself Oliver, or maybe that’s just its stripper name (Oliver Twist?). Another one of em dug up some priest’s garden, and apparently the city watch arrested it. Not sure if we should go try to bail it out.

We went to visit the library where I stopped another protoforged getting disassembled by some Professor who clearly got his degree out of a cornflakes sack. I learned a bit of stuff about the Astral plane - that its believed time is slower there, and that maybe you can travel by thinking. I can’t wait to be the fastest person in the party!

We decided to confide in Zorlan D’Cannith re RIPs dragonmark, hoping he might be able to help us out with air traffic control issues. After he prompted RIP to experiment some, we’re now pretty sure RIP can use all the dragonmark abilities. Zorlan introduced us to the Baron D’Lyrandar, neither of them was too happy about RIPs dragonmark, but the Baron said he could provide his niece Elly as a cover pilot for us. Only catch is, this is Elly the Black - House Lyrandar’s most wanted pirate. So, all we have to do is find her and convince her to abandon her life of crime and come work for us, plus either retrieve or scuttle her ship.

In other news (literally), we read that there is some tension regarding the fact that nobody has seen the Queen yet. RIP messaged Control, who asked us to stop by Wroat citadel at our earliest convenience. We also scryed on Saeshem, who has finished digging up and activating the colossus now. And House Orien have made a move on the Scrybox market, but nobody knows how they are filming.

Sora Kell

As if we didn’t have enough problems, Toquill showed up and warned us that the Daughters of Sora Kell are dangerous and might not share his world views (not sure which of those facts bothers him more), and that there’s irrational behaviour going on due to the plane of madness which we should probably check out at some point. The Sisters of Sora Kell are aligned with some ancient super-powerful beings called the Lords of Dust, who’s origins are unclear, which I have to say, hearing a DRAGON say "its ancient and powerful and I don’t know what it is" truly gives me the willies.
