**Start Date**: 26th Zarantry (Evening)

Heading through the searing furnace of the Fernian landscape, we came across Kas'a'lac, a supposedly "famous" merchant and his two slaves who were unconscious from the heat. After reviving one of them, we demanded to verify Kas'a'lac's ownership by inspecting his slavery contract, which he stupidly handed over and RIP promptly ate. We rob Kas'a'lac of about 10k worth of diamonds, the revived giff informs us his name is Jarrow, decides sticking with us is probably his best option, and then when we voice some concerns about Kas'a'lac's future silence concerning our treatment of him, promptly slits the merchant's throat. Fair enough, to be honest. We give him 1k worth of the diamond horde, I guess you could say these are now conflict diamonds. We dump all the incriminating evidence into the lava.

It turns out Kas'a'lac was on his way to the same place we were, so when we got there Elora convinced the gate guards we were there to represent him. After a time of waiting in which there were no biscuits, Mr Kifu demonstrated his armour by having a lizardfolk slave wear it and battle a fire octopus. We managed to get a moment alone with the lizardfolk whose name is Gakmam (Gak). Abel promised we would rescue all the slaves before we leave.

After finally getting some biscuits, Abel and Elora decide to go exploring, stopping first in a room titled "Legend Making", where a bunch of Fernia beings are busy doing exactly that - writing stories of legend. Abel manages to get a look at one titled "Heavenly Champion" which describes a finely crafted longsword engraved with the symbol of the Sovereign Hosts which is supposedly a key to open the tomb of Hamubai.

Further along the hall we get stopped by guards, where Abel promptly pretends to be an old woman on the verge of wetting herself (method acting at its best). During this distraction Elora sneaks further into the facility, discovering some sort of warehouse and a large worker golem. Returning from the outhouse, Abel, Adrik and RIP find a minecart hanging from the ceiling in the hallway, which appears to follow a track right past the guards into the facility. Abel can't resist jumping in, and everyone else follows. We head through the warehouse room, picking up Elora on the way, and into the next room. There is a slight harmonic noise, which is amplified when Adrik decides to push a button, and starts Elora's Cul'Strat resonating. Elora promptly plays the resonance on the Cul'Strat and unlocks its final power! But we will have to wait until a later episode to discover what it does! One of the machines in this room appears to be building something based on a Legend scroll. Adrik theorises that they are turning legend into fact, a literal literary manufacturing of legendary items.

We take the rolly cart into the next room, but Adrik just misses the bus. He manages to shake the guards pursuing him by ducking into a side room, then running back after RIP silences the area. The cart continues into the next room with Adrik scrambling to keep up. This final room appears to be what we were looking for - there is a huge anvil and a number of chains, and Kifu is here. The cart rolls in with Adrik dragging behind, his boots screeching along the floor. The magic in the room resonates the Cul'Strat, compelling Elora to break into a powerchord and somehow Kifu notices our stealthy entrance! After a short fight, RIP uses his legendary ability (create food and water) to explode a vat of molten something, which downs Kifu, Adrik and E-Rex, and breaks one of the chains.
