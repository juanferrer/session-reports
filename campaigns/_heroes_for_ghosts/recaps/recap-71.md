**Start Date**: 10th Zarantry --- ASTRAL-DAYS 10 (Early morning)
 
We got in and dispatched the first two mind-flayers very quickly, but soon some others showed up. We rescued Abel’s brother and were about to leave but he mentioned his prisoner. 
 
Some Mohim Krodroadd, an elf, sleeper agent. I still think it’s Elora’s father. Turns out Elora showed him how her father looked and it was him! Called it!
 
We finally killed the last two Githyanki after they misty stepped into us (‘cause RIP would not drop his anti-life shell…). Abel hacked (different kind of the hacking I do) the machine that controlled the cells and managed to cycle through some kind of security cameras in the ship.
 
We decided to hide the bodies and have Elora take a look around and find her father. I went with her in case things went south. We first arrived at the life support room, but went past it. Second room had a huge brain in it with a few Githyanki doing something there. Apparently this brain started speaking to Elora in her mind in her father’s voice. It said it was Elora’s father. 
 
He mentioned Quellion (the guy that teleported Elora away in the Tikka’s lair) and some other “Five”. He’s trying to make the Galathar empire rise again. He’s going to destroy the other nation and restore Cyre to what it was. 
Elora was having none of it, “you’re not my father”, she said, and cast lightning bolt towards it.
I called over the rest of the team with the speaking stone. The 4 githyanki around the brain suddenly started having the worst migraine I’ve ever seen. They raised their hands to their heads, which exploded, leaving their brains to fall on the floor, grow tentacles and started attacking me, trying to consume my brain. What’s their problem?!
 
I spent the entire combat stunned, so I didn’t do much, but everyone else was fighting the brain and destroying some pillars that were keeping it working. It was a bit strange. Elora put a wall of force around the brain and then RIP used wall of blades, essentially making a brain shredder.
 
The brain ended up teleporting away, so we took the cubic gate and went back to Xen’Drik. Two mind-flayers followed us and the people guarding the gate killed them.
