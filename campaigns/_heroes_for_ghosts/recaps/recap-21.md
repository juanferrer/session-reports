**Start Date**: 24th Nymm (early morning)
 
With the Deneith forces defeated and Scry News interviews complete the party prepared for the three day journey across the blade desert to the basilisk lairs. They realised they did not know what to do to make the basilisk oil, so sent a sending to Toquill. And received a slightly complicated answer. Goodbyes were said to Meriele (particularly by Adrik), who was going to escort her people and the prisoners back to Gatherhold. 
 
The journey across the blade desert was fairly uneventful; Elora spent some time with the salvaged feather fall packs and learned they were not charged and would require the spell to be cast on them three times each to get one stored charge [retcon because I forgot to explain this during the session - handout available in game].
 
The party decided to retrieve the trihorn egg as payment for Sas's services before tackling the basilisk. Sas asked for them not to hurt the trihorns and to only take one egg. Several plans to snag an egg we discussed but before one could be agreed upon Elora turned Able into an Eagle.
 
Able The Eagle took flight, her bird brain barely recalling the plan but knowing she fancied some eggs… Flying in the direction of the nests she was attacked by a flock of Glidewings and fled. RIP decided to distract the trihorns by blinding one of them but got engaged by them in the process. Adrik ran in to assist with some distracting firebolts and a very weak intimidation. Some of glidewings got barbequed by lightning, one go shot and pinned by Elora's new crossbow and Able The Eagle resumed her egg hunt. Landing by nest Able The Eagle struggled to remember what she was doing with the eggs and decided to eat one! RIP was preparing his own food diversion, using create food and water in front of the Trihorns. Elora dropped polymorph on Able, who wiped the yoke off her face and grabbed and egg before dimension dooring out of there. The rest of the party retreated to a safe distance and handed over payment to Sas.
 
After a rest and waiting for the cover of night the party set out to hunt down a basilisk. Sas and Pan remained in the camp. Elora reminded them of her research on the beasts; a basilisk looking at a creature that can see it will turn it to stone after a few seconds. Along the mountainous path a herd of petrified goats were discovered and the party was attacked by a couple of small troll-like creatures.
 
After a tough fight they took a short rest. Elora found it impossible to rest however, confessing her deep need to do some needle-based crafting. Eventually the elf unwound some rope and fashioned some makeshift knitting needles from crossbow bolts. The rest of the party expressed concern this could be connected with the strange dreams she'd been having or possibly some narcotics.
 
The group proceeded along the trail to find their most hated enemy - a broken bridge! Able levitated across, RIP jumped it, and Elora was hauled across by a rope. As is tradition the ungainly Adrik had to cross last, it now more difficult with several boards missing. The dwarf eventually made it across but only after doing his best yo-yo impression with four or five falls and being hauled back up.
 
Beyond the chasm an abandoned camp was discovered and a brief fight with some gargoyles was had before they were driven off. An investigation turned up a handful or standard adventuring gear and the knowledge that it had been abandoned for 2-4 weeks.
 
We left off as the party entered the cave in which the basilisk was thought to reside. Four squid-like creatures dropped from the ceiling, enveloping the heads of Able and RIP… and another tentacled beast emerged from the dark pool… reaching for the party!
 
**End Date**: 1st Lharvion (A little after Midnight)
