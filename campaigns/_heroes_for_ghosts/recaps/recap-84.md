**Start Date**: 5th Olarune (Early morning)

We start the Treasure Island event, quickly encountering and disabling three of Frapple's crewmates. Unfortunately Frapple beats us to the treasure… unfortunate for him, as a ghostly pirate spawns from the golden skull and tears off Frapple's face. Turns out, they found an actual cursed pirate skull for their pretend treasure. After a very difficult fight in which Elora is rendered unconscious, RIP eventually destroys the skull with Severance. We win Pirate Fest and crown Pan the Pirate King, but it is a rather subdued after-party considering the circumstances of our victory.

After returning to the airship, we have a long discussion about the pros and cons of breaking into the Dreadhold. We almost nope out, but after a very hypothetical conversation with Lysee which of course never actually happened, we instead decide to bring in a team of ringers for this mission.

Elora plays the Cul'Strat for us, one by one replacing us with an anti-hero of song. As each new prospective member of this suicide squad appears, they are convinced or paid to join up. Now they just need a plan to get inside…

**End Date**:  6th Olarune
