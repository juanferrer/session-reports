**Start Date**: 20th Zarantry (Early Morning)

After our epic battle with the Karnathi forces, Elora managed to call her broom back, but it was quite a bit more work to track down Adrik's. We managed to retrieve it, but it's gonna take some work to restore that bad boy to working order.

Xorlan d'Cannith called to let us Karnath has control of two colossus. We corrected him on that point, but that still means we may have to fight a fully active colossus at some point in the near future. Nordarr also called to let us know they've found two colossus, though the melee ability on one doesn't seem to be functional.

We headed east and found the rest of the Karnathi army marching toward Making with the colossus Artorok. Realising we have some time, we take a detour to check on the colossus Karnslayer. Turns out this thing has lost its legs, and has been dragging itself around in circles for so long it has worn a canyon into the landscape. With the whole party pretty horrified at what this thing had endured, Adrik borrowed RIPs broom to scout, and once the coast was clear Abel put an end to its suffering.

We headed back to the Karnathi army, and discussed how to approach. We spent about 2 hours developing a plan which (judging by past performance) would probably be useful for about 2 seconds. Since RIP's last "distraction" was so devastating, he decided to give an encore, this time using Sunbeam to wipe out half the army. Abel halo-dived off the airship toward the colossus, using dimension door at the last second to teleport into the cabin. While Adrik provided air support for RIP, dropping arcane charges on the Karnathi, Elora used invisibility to position herself for Abel's extraction. Upon disintegrating the colossus brain, along with its pilots, in rather gruesome fashion, Abel dimension door'd directly above the colossus, and Elora swooped in to catch her.

RIP and Adrik finish mopping up the army, and we all celebrate the impossible fact of a plan actually working pretty much perfectly for once.
