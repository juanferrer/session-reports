**Start Date**: 22nd Nymm (pre-dawn)

Following the explosion by the Jorasco house several party members rushed to investigate. Adrik attempted to help extinguish the flames; Elora sought to get her sister to safety and Able attempted to locate the arcane machine while RIP headed inside.

Upon finding the machine thought to be responsible for the effect cast on the residents (labelled wildlife repeller) RIP set about trying to destroy it; first by throwing various vials and alchemical ingredients at it and then by filling it with food from his create food and water spell. The latter was quite effective and the warforged left as the machine started to smoke and creak…

By this time Adrik had managed to extinguish the flames on the outside and headed in to look for his friend. To his horror he found RIP on his way out… setting more fires as he left. Elora had managed to get Meriele to her hut and was joined by Able who dispelled the charm on her.

Elora and Meriele had another reunion. It seemed she had little memory of the past few weeks at the site but she had come there willingly before the mind control took effect. Elora tried to get her out to safety but she insisted on returning to help the party fight.

The overseer of the settlement (Dr Calla de'Jorasco) had by this time risen from her sleep and come to investigate. She made the party a final offer to surrender and join the workforce willingly; stating she had called for reinforcements who would hunt them down and "clean up the site" if they did not find all in order when they arrived. Horrified by the threat of harm to "his babies", Mr Copperkettle opened hostilities by whacking Calla with his pan. Battle ensued.

A few seconds later the arcane machine gave up its fight against the food filling its workings and exploded! With the magical field sustaining them gone, forty two of the town's residents collapsed with exhaustion. The Jorasco guards and the Doctor were quickly overcome by the party's powers. Calla attempted to flee using invisibility but was followed by Adrik and cut down.

RIP attempted to save as many of the civilians as possible but 27 died from exhaustion. Calla de'Jorasco was brought back for questioning and the rest of the staff restrained. The party learned that the call for reinforcements meant a squad of House Denith mercenaries would be on their way, probably by airship. Adrik recalled the distance to the nearest Denith base in Karrnath would put them at least 48 hours away (ETA > 0300 24th Nymm).

Mt Copperkettle was very confused about the problem with the morality of helping the workers work harder, longer and need less rest. RIP attempted to educate him by setting him to work on burying the dead. He explained that now all the potions had been destroyed the workers would get sick each day they did not take one until the effect fully wore off.

Watches were set and the party rested. Waking next morning to start preparing for the assault. The north face of the Jorasco house was patched up to 'look normal' from that direction. A trench was dug and filled with spikes. And a number of blasting charges were laid out as mines surrounding the village. Sas was sent to seek any help he could find from local nomads and the party attempted to save as many civilians as possible as they succumbed to the withdrawal.

A little over 24 hours before the expected assault the party's rest was interrupted by a T-Rex approaching the village. No longer repelled by the Jorasco device the beast lumbered into the settlement after spotting a tasty looking gnome snack on one of the roofs! Setting off two of the explosive traps the creature was injured by enraged as it started attacking the party. Able fell and it was a close call with most of the others before it was finally cut down by Adrik.

**End Date**: 23rd Nymm (just after midnight)

**Loot**: Overseer's Spade, Wand of magic missiles, Dr Calla's braces
