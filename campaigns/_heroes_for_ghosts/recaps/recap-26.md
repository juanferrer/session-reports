"Well he works for you doesn't he", was the answer given to Control's question. The spy chief insisted Toquill was not working for her and was deeply alarmed about him having a CPAD in Sharn. An information exchange (Squid poke slow) was agreed where the party offered up Toquill's address and likeness (via minor illusion complete with open dressing gown) and C described how there was no solid evidence for their being a Lord Of Blades warforged in the Mournland, but conceded some warforged had gone into the mist seeking him and had not returned. She also answered the question about General Nordar and the Ziggurat, saying as far as she knew no others had been found since the group was in Grosk. As soon as Breeland's head spook left the building, RIP sent their patron a sending, warning him of the probable incoming security forces - the gentleman seemed unconcerned by this news.
 
A Scrype call was made to Lysse d'Sivis where it was agreed Pan could journey with them and film the expedition into the Mournland, on the condition that some editorial restraint was used in the event of anything truly shocking being discovered as to the cause of the Mourning. A generous remuneration offer was made of one copper per person per viewer for each of their daily shows. And Pan was to be issued with a 300g diamond in case of revivification. Elora's request for an airship was answered with a parental "Maybe later". Mourning Glory was decided as the title for their new show.
 
Elora met Mereile in town. She told Elora she and 215 of the settlers had decided to stay on the plains and they were buying supplies to go set up at Pashchim. She gave her sister a map of old Cyre and a picture of them from her new arcane camera. Adrik got a selfie and a kiss. 
Sas was also found in town. He declined their offer to go into the Mournland as he'd also been offered his own show in the Scry Network 'Sas Ciladan Dinosaur Hunter'. Though he did offer to ride with them to the border and bring their mounts back to stable in Gatherhold. Pan flexed on Sas's cameraman, pointing out how the stars of the network would probably have an airship for their return journey. 
 
Arriving at the border the group found the bridge to be partly out of phase, with chucks of it incorporeal. Rather than attempting to cross it they decided to rope up and use water-walking to reach the other side. A plan briefly interrupted by a pair of plesiosauruses. The dino's breakfast was rudely snatched away from them however by Able's control-water-generated tidal wave. Tangled in the ropes binding them the party unceremoniously landed on the far bank and took a significant amount of damage. Only Pan stuck the landing.
 
Inside the Mourning for the first time, several members of the party noted the weird taste of purple and smell of a poorly tuned piano in the air. They settled down for a short rest, only healing half the expected amount and trying to ignore the hail of teeth falling from the sky. Able pocketed one of the teeth in the witch's skin pouch.
 
A few hours into their walk west to Metrol, RIP noticed they seemed to be going in a loop, passing the same tree over and over. Elora confirmed this by placing a rock in the middle of the path and finding they came back to it about five minutes up the road. Que creepy child laughter coming from the woods. After several theories and experiments Elroa tried telling a joke to the disembodied laughing and got the sense it was coming from the north. As soon as the party set foot off the road in that direction they got the first verse of a haunting nursery rhyme. After some trial and error Able and Adrik realised they were in a maze. Going the right way advanced the song, while a wrong turn put them back a verse. Eventually by making a loop and completing the song they found themselves back on the road and the game apparently over.
 
Further along the road Elora started to hallucinate cockroaches crawling around and over herâ€¦ burrowing into her. Quite prophetically as at the same time Able was inspecting a quivering and whimpering dog that turned out to be full of Rot Grubs. As it burst out four of the creatures burrowed into the gnome. Elora incinerated the remaining grubs with a lightning bolt but the four remained in Able burrowing up her leg. Adrik readied his axe, preparing for some urgent surgery but in her panic the wizard misty stepped away and discovered a novel way to remove the parasites as they were left behind.
 
We finished off with night apparently drawing in and the party setting watch, ready to use Able's tiny hut spell when it came time to sleep.
