**Start Date**: 27th Barrakas (Early morning - on Eberron)

Hasanas was tasked with getting passes for level 55 (shopping) while the party headed to the Hellcienda to scout the venue. Choosing a diva persona, Elora was escorted from the cartridge as the rest of the party chastised the doormen for the lack of a welcome. The club was closed but the hostess (Trugen) agreed to give them a tour and show them to the dressing room. She wasn't prepared to give them details of the band Elora would be facing but one of the party caught sight of the name Rage Against the Divine on her clipboard. Elora knew of them (a band of barbarians from the Daemon Wastes) but not heard them play. RIP and Adrik checked out the kitchen and learned the chef was a bit of a diva himself. Abel performed a sound check while singing the code word "So Horny" on stage, but received no reply. Elora checked out the VIP suite and stole some very expensive wine and some unidentified drugs. The drugs were planted in the opponents’ dressing room and the party left for their shopping spree.

Taking the portal to level 55 the party found themselves in a brightly lit warehouse-like complex. Greeted by a low level devil they were given stubby pencils and a scrap of paper to note items they wanted to buy. On entering the first hall, despite not going there to buy furniture Elora felt the need to purchase a red sofa for their airship. Eager to get on with the task at hand Abel moved to the next hall but found herself separated from the party, quite lost and in the toilets! The wizard dimension doored to the entrance and demanded a map from the leamur greeter.

With the map and RIPs greater sense of direction the group was able to make it through the rest of the store, picking up a bag of holding, some makeup (disguise kit), a couple of braziers, four hours of lamp oil, two scrolls of invisibility, an arcane guitar, a costume for Elora, three suits for their security entourage and a portion of meatballs. Arriving at the checkout they found the store would only accept a Brelish Express card as payment. They considered their options and decided to run for the exit and risk the fine. Total goods stolen 1020g.

Back at the club Elora found Demoth's quarters guarded by a bouncer and tried flirting with him. RIP went to the kitchen and was enlisted Chef Vorkan to help gut, skin and debone a box of pixies that were destined for the pixie nut bake. A few of the tiny fairy corpses were contaminated but RIP was able to hide/save them for later… Adrik tried to scout with the Zephyr cushion but could not find a big enough gap to get the arcane eye through. On his astrally-projected way, he did notice RIP working in the kitchen and so took Abel to go help. Adrik was tasked with mixing a new cocktail that they named "So Horny". It wasn't completely successful and lead to him being ejected from the Kitchen but did give Abel the chance to go and ask the customers if they wanted a "So Horny". RIP moved on to making the ice cream for the Baked Cyre (Crispy on the outside and cold as a corpse in the middle) and again sequestered some portions with broken glass for later use. Pleased with the results, Vorkan let the group keep their kitchen outfits.

Abel had noticed the cloakroom imp had responded to her shouts advertising the "So Horny" cocktail and gathered RIP and Adrik to go talk to him. The Imp (Dix) was indeed Hasanas' man on the inside. Keen to help Has in the hope he would elevate him to a management position and throw him "a bit of scratch" if he regained his previous position of power. Dix told the party Demoth kept his contracts and most prize positions in a safe in his suite; and that safe had a musical lock.

Meanwhile Elora had used one of the scrolls of invisibility to investigate the north east wing. Our bard found Demoth's suite to be locked and so tried his office. Inside she was shocked to find the handsome devil sitting behind the desk looked a lot like Lumi, the "human" bard who had trained her in music after she left the army. Feeling betrayed by her lost friend (lover?) she called him a bastard and dropped the invisibility. Lumi was surprised and pleased to see her and in the conversation that followed Elora learned her bardic skills had come in part from a pact she had made with this devil, she was under contract with Phony Music. Enraged, she threw a lightning bolt at the devil, which he shrugged off and commanded her to play for him in the battle of the bards. Elora rushed from the room in tears of betrayal, knowing she had to obey.

Leaving the cloakroom the rest of the party spotted their friend, in her thigh high boots, crop top, sobbing in the corridor with makeup running down her face (classic nightclub scene). Ushering her back to the dressing room they learned about Lumi but reassured Elora they could fix it.	They just had to get into the vault and destroy Elora's contract! Depressed Elora necked the stone wine.

RIP delivered the tainted food to the other band and Pan told the group about the drugs he'd learned were on sale in the chillout room. Abel and Adrik bought some Hazard, a drug that negated the effects of the plane (they could now roll skills and tell lies). Abel reapplied the lightning bolt and tear makeup, nailing it on the second attempt.

Wondering if they could get into Lumi Demoth's quarters via a window the party exited the club, telling the hostess Elora just needed some air. There were indeed windows and the group used the portable hole to get inside. The gaudily decorated bedroom contained a four poster bed with mirror above it, a purple shag carpet, dresser with hair and horn dye, chests of expensive clothes and a painting of a bare-chested playing his guitar with half-naked woman fawning over him. Immediately suspecting the painting hid the safe. Abel tried to dispel it… to no effect. RIP emptied the remaining food bag into the clothes chests and Elora tried playing the music on the stand. The music (How Great Thou Flame) at first had no effect but when Elora noticed it in the mirror and tried playing it backwards the painting dissolved and revealed the entrance to the safe.

Inside the final obstacles stood between them, the Cul'Strat and the shelves of contracts. A laser barrier controlled by a keypad they did not know the code to and a clearly trapped floor. A plan was formed, Abel levitated herself, dimension doored above the display case, opened it and took the instrument…. Alarms sounded! RIP cast (?) igniting the contracts as Abel dimension doored back out. The party left by the portable hole and casually walked back in the main entrance in time to see security running towards the suite.

Back in the dressing room Elora pulled out the Cul'Strat and played an epic rift…!
