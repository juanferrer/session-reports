Transcript from Fight of the Day on Scry Sports One.
With Lodon Garrick & Raswor Omantrowl

>
> **Lodon**: Well, Ras, it's quite a day at the Red Ring here in Stromreach.
>
> **Raswor**: Sure was, mate. Let's look back at some of the highlights.
>
> **L**: First up we had the Duck Tape Warriors vs The Constructs.
>
> **R**: This was always going to be a hard fight, Don, but these guys did struggle a bit.
>
> **L**: Too right Ras! They opened up with a classic 1-2-3 magic missile from Bob, backed up with Blindness cast by the Gravedigger. That sure made it hard for two of the clockwork constructs.
>
> **R**: How about that Bearing Golem, though, mate. What a legend!
>
> **L**: Yes, here we can see it sliding up to Bob The Wizard and POWW! Blows itself up! Blasting several of The Warriors with shrapnel.
>
> **R**: Ouch! They were not expecting that, Don.
>
> **L**: No, they weren't! You can see on the replay, Bob cannot get out there quick enough! Glugs a healing potion and Bamfs to the other side of the arena.
>
> **R**: Fair dinkum, mate. Another hit and she'll be a gonna.
>
> **L**: And here's the Gravedigger telling The Devastator "I got this".
>
> **R**: I'm not sure the Dwarf believed him but he's going to help with the golem.
>
> **L**: Some nice rifts from the Joker on her sword of resonance.
>
> **R**: They're sure gonna need that inspiration, mate.
>
> **L**: Nice use of the Reap and Sew, pinning them down.
>
> **R**: That spider thing is still blinded and does not know where to fire its beam.
>
> **L**: Very nice hit with the bow from the Joker followed by blows from the Devastator. That’s the mantis down.
>
> **R**: The golem has reformed and looks to be trying to slip away from the Devastator but he's not having it.
>
> **L**: I think this is the point they turn the fight around. The Devastator is smashing the shit out of those bearings.
>
> **R**: Classic Toll The Dead and that's it. First fight in the bag for Duck Tape Warriors!
>
> **R**: Well with the Heathens out of the running it's just The Ringmasters, The Best of the Beast and the Duck Tape Warriors left.
>
> **L**: Let's take a look back at The Duck's second fight, mate.
>
> **R**: This went far better than the first, Don.
>
> **L**: It sure did, mate. Which was lucky, some of them are still bloodied from round one.
>
> **R**: The Devastator starting off with his Phase axe. A real crowd pleaser.
>
> **L**: And more blindness from The Gravedigger.
>
> **R**: The giant ape has got away from them though and headed straight for the wizard.
>
> **L**: Kapow! That's a punch and a half mate. Its fist is bigger than the gnome!
>
> **R**: But she bamfs over to the net and looks like she's caught a behemoth!
>
> **L**: Bold move. There is still plenty of time for it to break loose!
>
> **R**: No chance of that, mate. The Gravedigger has banished it!
>
> **L**: Eeeeeee-REX!!!
>
> **R**: The crowd has gone WILD!
>
> **L**: Well if they'd ever wondered who would win in a fight between a giant ape and a tyrannosaurus it looks like they are gonna find out…
>
> **R**: Spoiler alert it's not the monkey!
>
> **L**: Looks like it's arm day for The Devastator. His axe is sure getting a workout!
>
> **R**: Oh no! The sand drake has got some good bites in on E-Rex and the bard has lost concentration on the polymorph!
>
> **L**: That's gonna be a disappointment for her and the crowd, Ras!
>
> **R**: It's not gonna matter, mate. With all those missiles and axes flying the drake is down and shortly followed by the ape.
>
> **L**: With the behemoth still banished the Ref's called it! Victory for the Ducks!
>
> **R**: With the team making their way back to their changing room for a rest before the final it looks like the arena attendants are gonna have to try and put that behemoth back in its box.
>
> **L**: Final time, mate.
>
> **R**: It's not too much of a surprise to see it's The Ring Masters vs The Duck Tape Warriors.
>
> **L**: Hometown champions vs the stars of the Scry Network.
>
> **R**: The bookies have the Masters as favourites but my money would be on the Warriors.
>
> **L**: No arguments here and it seems our Scry audience agrees. Got a message here from @ChervianDG who says "When you've seen them take down a beholder arch mage in seconds you know these Ring Masters are about to get skooled!"
>
> **R**: Another from @draconicportents, that simply says "Get wrecked! Ducks FTW"
>
> **L**: Seems like the audience back in Khovaire are behind the Ducks. Remember you can message us from any Sivis station @ScryFOTD.
>
> **R**: BAM Bob laying down some DOTs with Synaptic Static.
>
> **L**: Oh and looks like she knew their wizard was going to struggle with the save!
>
> **R**: The Gravedigger has heard enough - he's dropped silence on them.
>
> **L**: Flurin's got out of it though and gone straight to the oil trap, hoping to catch the Duck's cleric.
>
> **R**: No, Flurin's going for a spell…
>
> **L**: Counterspell from the Joker!
>
> **R**: It was only a matter of time. A cracking joke from The Joker has them rolling on the ground.
>
> **L**: I'm starting to feel bad for the Masters, Ras. This is humiliating for them.
>
> **R**: Devastator tosses a firebolt at the gas trap that Silent Zirlus has made the mistake of standing by.
>
> **L**: BOOM! He's triggered it. They are now literally dying of laughter in that cloud.
>
> **R**: Bob's gone for the unstable wall and animated the bricks!
>
> **L**: A Bane from The Gravedigger.
>
> **R**: They're really piling on the de-buffs.
>
> **L**: Silent Zirlus has got off a shot against Bob. Shield!.. but it's not going to matter. That poisoned dart's gonna sting.
>
> **R**: Hungry Alkrus looks like he wants a bite of Warfoged! It don't look too tasty to me, should have had a sandwich.
>
> **L**: I don't think the forged was expecting him to hit so hard. But he's decided to take him out of the fight!
>
> **R**: Banishment 5th level!
>
> **L**: That's their tank and bard off the board, Ras!
>
> **R**: Yes, Don, it's not looking good for The Ring Masters
>
> **L**: Pale Pasha's still dying of laughter and it looks like Flurin is trying to break concentration on the banishment with a high level fireball but has mistakenly targeted Bob!
>
> **R**: The Devastator's going in axe swinging.
>
> **L**: Lightning bolt!
>
> **R**: The Gravedigger is calling time on this fight with Toll the Dead.
>
> **L**: That's it, mate. The Ring Masters are defeated. The Duck Tape Warriors smashed it in the third round to take the prize, a very rare Charm Of Revivification!
>
> **R**: They'll be pleased with that result, mate.
>
> **L**: That about wraps it up from us here in the Red Ring but don't forget you can catch more of these champions in Mourning Glory on Scry One nightly and previous episodes on Scry Venture.
>
> **L**: I've been Lodon Garrick
>
> **R**: And I've been Raswor Omantrowl
>
> **L**: From Scry Sports Fight of the Day - Goodnight.
