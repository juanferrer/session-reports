Pan doing a piece to camera, "Many of you will have been concerned, distraught even, to see our Scry feed go dark as your favourite heroes stepped through the Gate Portal yesterday. But have no fear they were not lost, nor painfully annihilated as the newly formed anti-gaters have been claiming. No, we simply know now that the Scry Cam cannot transmit across the planes. But don't worry our top magewrightes are working with the boffins at House Cannith on a solution as we speak. For now though after our pitstop at Stormreach for supplies we are once again venturing into the Khyber tunnels in search of and determined to rescue Tishnar from the clutches of the so-called Sisters. As we make this trek I will be interviewing all four members"
 
> *"Adrik, it must be a difficult time with your sister being held captive while you are forced to retrieve these 'tools' for the sisters. What can you tell us about what happened while we were off-air"*
>
> *"We went to the plane of order and it was a bureaucratic mess. Everything required a permit or a licence. There were no local shops. We got lost in this huge EyeKEA, where they didn't accept any form of payment available to us. We visited the famous Hellcienda. Lovely establishment, but the owner was not. We were invited along with Elora. She was there to perform in a duel against another band representing the owner of the place. This guy then pulled a previous contract that forced Elora to play for him. We managed to get her out of that contract and the crowd loved her.*
> *... I think the building is now under new management."*
 
"Elora, you were, in a manner of speaking, the star of the show here. Have you anything to add to Adrik's recollection of events"…. Elora without saying anything takes the Cul'Strat that she was already fiddling with and starts to smash out a rendition of her performance in the Hellcienda. It's not quite as good as the original (22) but the unique sound of the Cul'Strat makes it a decent performance.
 
"RIP, no… no… you don't need to stare at the camera… look at me…"
> RIP, staring at the camera in a mono-tone voice, *"We got some clues how to unlock the scythe, Elora unlocked one of her guitar abilities, we did some shopping and got a rod for the plane of flames. That was after Elora won the competition with… 166 to 103 if I remember right. Oh and we told big bad ass devil girl that devil dude was a farce, then we had a lot of drinks"*
 
"And finally Abel, what do you remember about your time on Daanvi, the plane of perfect order?"
 
> *"Plane of Order? Pah, nuttin orderly about it. The second we landed, some clockwork tin can tried to slap us with a fine. I shoulda took him apart with my tinkers tools, but frankly I couldn’t abide the paperwork that would’ve required.*
>
> *Anyways, turned out we haint been invited for a nice dinner party, instead it were that devil fella what needed our help, cause he’d ante’d up for a poker hand he weren’t gonna win. He was trying to get established as some sort of music mogul with his Supernatural record label, and he’d challenged the head of Phony Music to a Bard-off. We weren’t that interested in spending more time in this bew-ro-craptic hellhole until we found out this Phoney records chap had the very thing we was looking for.*
> 
> *Well, we have a bard, maybe even the best one in all Eberron, even if she’s got a fat head, so we amble on over to the club with Elora playing super-diva. Elora finds out the Phoney guy is her ex-boyfriend and he’s still got a power over her and goes from acting like a bitch to crying like one.*
>
> *RIP ends up helping out in the kitchen, with his fascination with food lately it’s a damn good thing warforged don’t get fat. Actually do warforged get fat? I don’t know. Ain't never seen a fat one. So basically, he poisons the rival band, Adrik invents a new cocktail which frankly tasted worse than RIPs cooking on a bad day, but people drank it anyways cause I told em how good it was.*
> 
> *We managed to hook up with a SPY what Hesanas had in the place. I shall protect SPY's identity, but SPY gave us some helpful information on Phoney guys’ private quarters and what we might find in there. Oh yeah, that chef guy was so impressed with RIPs poisonous cooking and Adrik’s shit cocktail that he gave us some servants' outfits that we never actually used.*
> 
> *Instead we snuck in by making a magic hole in the wall of his quarters, and then Elora figured out this musical puzzle lock thingy to get into Phoney guys Sancus scrotorium. There was the artefact, a rainbow loot thing which I’m sure dear viewers that Elora will demonstrate for you (whether you want her to or not), and also all the demon’s paperwork was in there, and in this plane seems like the more papers you got the more power you got.*
> 
> *So, being the subtle and cunning folks that we are, we came up with the very clever plan of just snatching the loot and setting fire to everything.*
> 
> *With the bad guys' papers all burned up, and a suitable dose of drugs, Elora felt much better, and I would say she played like a demon, but I dunno if that’s appropriate considering the venue, wouldn’t want anyone thinking I’m racist. Phoney guy tried to interrupt the performance, but that really pissed off the lady demon judge, who was sexy and scary and sure as shit not someone I would have messed with. Then RIP made Phoney guy disappear which just made him even madder when he came back, but RIP shopped him to the badass demon woman for losing all his paperwork, and probably she’s going to bust him down to a greeting robot or something.*
>
> *Afterwards we all had some epic cocktails mixed by a gnome named Bruce, I think Bruce got into the bartending business by accident, but he’s coming back to the material plane now, and if he decides to stay in the business I can HIGHLY RECOMMEND his cocktails. Plus he’s a real likeable fella.*
> 
> *So that were a lot of fun and high jinks, but now we are back to SERIOUS business and next episode we will definitely be facing uncertain death as we go to rescue Adrik’s sister. I think we are all learning a valuable lesson, which is that we really need to stop misplacing our family members."*
 
"Well that's it from us for now. Join us on Scry One tomorrow night to see how it worked out at Verdant!"
