**Start Date**: 7th Olarune (Midday)

Arriving in the Xen'Drik cemetery, we are greeted by the arrival of the Devils who had been working for Abel, who present her with a gift of 37 volumes of Daanvi etiquette. That'll be useful for the afterlife! RatDrop thanks us for his freedom and scarpers. On the way to One Good Tern we stop in at Caebrek and Daughter, now renamed Caebrek Clan Expeditions and Recovery. Seems Adrik has been properly accepted back into the family. Adrik invites us all over for dinner, keen for his mum to get to know Elora's mum.

After Shaeva gets out of her prison jumpsuit, she tells us that someone is impersonating her now, living in her property in Wroat for which there is a spare key under a rock in the fountain. She also gives us the location of the secret passage from which Control can be spied on. Lycee contacts us and you can imagine our surprise when she tells us how horribly wrong things have gone in the Dreadhold! Fortunately she knows a group of competent adventurers who can clean it up, in exchange for a teleport circle to Krona Peak which has the best shopping in the land. Shaeva and Lycee make a deal for Shaeva to work with Lycee going forward, which should give her some measure of protection.

The next morning we redirect Ellie towards Krona Peak, send Shaeva to Sharn, discover that the Kundarak Vault in Xen'Drik has been burgled overnight, and receive a gift of a shield device for our airship that Adrik's sister found, before teleporting to Krona Peak. We did some shopping at the Bazaar of the Four Winds and Adrik left some Fernixium with a blacksmith to make into an amulet. After our shopping, Elora summoned Krek back to brief us on what happened in the Dreadhold.

We get back on our airship when it arrives and head for the Dreadhold. The new captain of the guard, Rogda D'Kundarak gives us a rundown of the two demon lords which still need dealing with down on Deep Ward, and asks us to see if we can re-establish the magical containment system which is in a room on the lowest level and existed before the prison was even built. I think we need to start doing public service announcements about what a bad idea it is to tap into ancient and mysterious power sources.

**End Date**: 10th Olarune (4pm)
