NorrDog reacted a little strangely when we asked it to find Arkus, pointing toward Metrol but then doing a sort of doggy shrug. As we travel to Metrol the "Queen" calls us and tries to convince us to stop Nordar from destroying the remaining colossus. Also tells us that there is now a 2k per head bounty on us in Karnath. Wups.

Reaching Metrol, we head for the airship hangers which seem like they'd be big enough to house a colossus and use the portable hole to get in. Inside we find an empty gantry which could have housed Arkus, and a crazy guy who has apparently been surviving on chocolate pudding for four years. He is ranting about a man with glowy eyes stealing the colossus, which was apparently both here last week and also never was here. Adrik recognises a pattern of numbers amongst his wild ramblings, which we later find to be a new prophecy on the Epidiascope: "When the indivisible is mirrored thirty and six futures are shown. Between the twelfth blind man and an age of rest there lies a change in position and a truth untold."

We manage to convince Ermin (the looney) that his shift is over, and he should come to the "pub" (our airship). We'll drop him off with the Brelish army later to get some help.

General Nordar calls us and reports on the progress with locating and destroying the remaining colossus. Also lets us know about a Kek'Zerrat contact in Rekkensmitty named Zardak who might be able to give us a bit more intel on the area around the ice castle. Also shares her opinion that Control has become a wee bit unstable, and that Prince Orgath died in a mysterious lightning rail fire shortly after visiting with the "Queen". We stop off at Flamekeep to do some shopping. Abel helped Adrik finish repairing his broom. Elora scried on Control who was asking some man "Is he secured?", and also noticed something about "Dreadhold" amongst Control's paperwork.

We headed for the Egret Nothing to meet with the contact. Used seeming to disguise ourselves as "not us" and pretended to be a band of green adventurers. We even completed the newbie quest to kill rats in the tavern cellar, it was a glorious battle and we were victorious! We met with our contact who let us know about some possible entry points, and the more brave amongst us tried the tavern's "animal" stew, which was pretty bad.

We headed out to the ice spire, but on arriving we realised to our extreme surprise that the castle made of ice and surrounded by snow was COLD and we had totally failed to prepare. We left again and sent Elly into town to buy us some warm clothes.
