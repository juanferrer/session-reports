**Start Date**: 20th Rhaan (Early Morning)

Turns out launching into the astral sea in the equivalent of a tin can was not the best plan ever. Almost immediately we left Eberron behind it started sounding like a hailstorm, and then something punched a hole in our vessel and all our air started leaking out. Elora bought us some thinking time by using wall of force to hold the air in. We ended up patching the hole with the seat from an oak stool that we'd stashed in trunkie at some point (why!?) and sealed the edges with a sticky dough RIP conjured up using his MVP spell, create food and water.

We almost needn't have bothered, as right after that we passed through some kinda mega-magic field which exploded the main console and ended up plowing the vessel into a great big chunk of rock. We were pretty banged up, and our spacecraft was toast, but at least it seemed like this rock had air, which we had previously been rather short on. RIP used his shovel to start digging us a tunnel out via the ruined viewport, meantime we could hear something digging down to the door. When we popped out the tunnel RIP had dug to see what was trying to get in.. well, it was unexpected. Looked a bit like one of them hippo things like they have at Sharn zoo, except humanoid and dressed in a uniform with a hat that I'm sure Pan was coveting.

After magic-ing up some language skills, we established several facts. Firstly, the creature was named BB. Secondly, we are officially in the astral sea. Thirdly, BB's ship also crashed here. Fourthly, he is aware of some other Eberron beings in the astral sea which just appeared one day about four months ago, some of them dead or injured. Could be Ammeron's unit what got exploded here by the C-Pad.

Anyways, we followed BB back to his space vessel, "The (Reformed) Optimist", which was a good deal nicer than ours (even before it got smooshed). He further explained that there are various settlements throughout the astral sea, and he's from one far from here. The main inhabitants are the Giff of which he is one, but there are also Githzerai which as near as I can tell are space elves, and Githyanki which seem to be space drow.
He says if we help get his ship working again, he can sail us wherever to try to find my brother. The to-do list looks like this:

- Recover the sensors from a whistling critter that stole them
- Repair the sail
- Fix the air system
- Dig out the engine
- Take care of the grichlich in the engine room

He says the grichlich is some kind of dog size spider that infests people with something that makes their bellies explode. I guess it got to his crew and he killed them all rather than wait for them explode. This guy has had a real bad day.

We put Adrik to work digging out the engine while the rest of us went after the Whistler. We tracked it to a cave which had a mossy patch (RIP and I both tried eating the moss, I don't know why we did that, it basically tasted like you'd expect), and then a cavern filled with purple crystals, which Elora immediately grabbed and tried to lick. She was so busy inspecting them, she didn't notice the huge crystal golem rising up behind her. Fortunately the creature wasn't too much of a challenge for us, though it did damage Elora some, and we left it (literally) shattered. No sign of the sensors, so we carried on further into the cave.

Further in, we came across some unusual mushrooms, and I was determined to get some samples for Brella. Space mushrooms could have some amazing properties, well as it turns out they DO. The first one I tried to pick made a big thunderclap which stunned us, so I got RIP to cast silence so I could harvest it. The second one gave off a flashing light which blinded us, and as we groped around blindly, Elora set off the third one, which terrified her and sent her running right back into the blinding oneâ€¦ it was a comedy of mushrooms as we tried to move down the corridor being continually blind, stunned and terrified!

Eventually RIP used blade barrier to clear a path halfway, and then a combination of control water and water walking to make ourselves a water path over the mushrooms. We arrived to a room which looked like the lair of a tech-savvy magpie, and discovered the source of the whistling - a ginormous fangy pink mouse thing. The Whistler was very resistant to our magics which made us regret leaving Adrik at the ship. It almost ruined Elora, but just as it was about to finish eating her face she managed to fear it, and then I finished it off with the most powerful lightning bolt I could summon.

I reckon Sass should come out here for his next Skry season, the wildlife seems right up his alley.
