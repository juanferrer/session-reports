**Start Date**: 21st Lharviron (Midday)

The party decided to rest up for the day at the Reforged base. Twenty Two clarified the tasks the Reforged were keen on getting help with:
 
Get into the Kundarak vault so they could retrieve caches of dragon shards, saying they needed a power source.
Retrieve some records from the Palace of Earth that related to land owned by House Cannith in Cyre.
Rid the city of the Overseer and their minions
 
Abel expressed concern over the motivations of the Reforged leader (Sachem). Twenty Two refused to say where he and the main Reforged base was but made the offer that they could visit him if they helped with their tasks.
 
RIP spent some time among the other warforged, having never seen so many of his own kind before. Adrik attempted some anthropological study of the forged, trying to see if there was any sign of romantic attachment between them. He only saw signs of platonic friendship and was left concerned about RIPs prospects for happiness.
 
After a rest the Party set out with a platoon of Reforged and Twenty Two to the Palace of Wind with the intent to rob a bank! Inside they found a large statue of the queen and briefly considered if she might be the petrified remains of the monarch. They decided to test a theory that a petrified body may show internal structures and so broke off a finger to look for any sign of fossilised bone… there was none. Elora showed remarkable recollection of the layout of the palace and so set off directly to the bank in the east wing.
 
Along the way the group ran into a couple of ghostly mourners followed by more corporeal undead in the foyer of the bank. Both Adrik and Elora tried to hold doors closed to keep the undead inside. One of the undead with a disgusting elongated tough burst forced its way out of the door Adrik was holding and Elora gloated about how she had had no trouble keeping hers shut… until it was discovered she was holding a door to an empty room. With the first set of undead dispatched Abel teased the still unliving ones from behind the glass screens while RIP worked on the lock blocking their progress. Meanwhile Adrik and Elora searched the officers and turned up a small white stone marked with dwarven runes. As RIP finished with the lock he opened the door to find a corpse filled plant waiting on the other side… and finally getting an opportunity to use Blight as it was intended, dealing a whopping 64 damage.
 
With the remaining undead mopped up and another seven rune stones recovered the group entered the vault room. As the party moved around the room a glyph depicting the Kundarak mark started to glow and a recorded voice announced "Kundarak authorisation acknowledged, proceed with unlock protocol". Glyphs appeared on floor panels and the controls allowing them to be rotated came to life. The group quickly realised they needed to rotate the glyphs so all paths connected and when they achieved that the floor folded in on itself to reveal steps to the main vault.
 
Down in the main vault eight doors sealed the areas where valuables were stored. Notably one of the doors was red hot, one was freezing cold and a third had an orchid growing out of it. The party noticed panels by each of the doors that seemed to fit the rune stones they had found. Examining each of the panels it was clear they only had enough runes to open the north east vault. Quite some time passed as various theories were tried out as to how the runes needed to be arranged until eventually a working solution was found. The door folded in on itself, seeming to twist through more than the three normal dimensions as it did so.
 
Inside a long dead, putrefied, Kundarak dwarf was found. He had on him a set of keys to the vault's strong boxes and another rune. The group set about opening the strong boxes and looting valuables. One of the safes contained a box marked with a number of arcane warning symbols that Abel recognised as denoting a Sphere of Annihilation - Twenty Two immediately staked a claim to it, saying it was the power source that Sachem needed. Pressed on the matter by a party unwilling to hand over such a powerful and dangerous item she said the power source was needed for their vessel that would transport them to their promised land. She agreed the party may keep hold of it provided they did so by bringing it to Sachem when they were finished in the city.
 
We finished off with Elora casting speak with dead on the dwarf and learning he had hidden in the vault when the Mourning occurred, but became trapped. When suggested there was an item that could have got him out (the sphere) he replied there was nothing that could get in or out of the vault. As the party vacated the vault and recovered the key runes Elora started on the combination to the north vault and the rest considered looking for who had stored the sphere there in the first place.
