**Start Date**: 9th Barrakas (Pre-dawn)

Cautious of the obelisk, the party carried the unconscious body of Jonas Wylkes out of the manor and to the waiting Iron Watch outside. They explained the situation to Ortor Sel Shadra and arranged to have the unconscious storm lord discreetly moved to the station house, while the warforged watchmen kept the house quarantined.

Jonas was brought back to consciousness and after some confusion confessed he had acquired the obelisk from some smugglers who had been attempting to ship it out of the port without paying tax on it. He asked the group's help in removing or destroying it and agreed to stay the night in the watch house (for the town's safety).

After a night's rest the party set out to pick up some supplies before making enquiries about the Cubic Gate and the Obelisk. At Southern Splendours (magic shop) the proprietor (Rob the elf) immediately offered 10,000 gold for the item and was able to explain a little about what it did. He translated the text on each of the sides, one per side was a plain of reality (written in giant) and the other two on each side were gibberish giant runes. The party rejected his low-ball offer and the following one for 15,000 gp before leaving to see if they could make it work out in the woods.

Along the way to Old Mill woods they stopped by the Omaren residence to see if Lacey Omaren had turned up. The Iron Watch there explained she had not and that her father was bereft with worry. Elora attempted to scry on the woman and discovered her to be in some sort of dark cave-like environment, bound and with drow talking nearby! Varhoe described how the drow would use passages through Khyber (the Eberron Underdark). He added their passages through Khyber were often hard to find or difficult to enter and sometimes offered shortcuts across great distances.

Touching the cube on a side caused the mechanism to rotate to face it and flash twice. They tried reading the name of the plains and the gibberish runes but the behaviour remained the same and no gate was opened. RIP considered using Legend Lore, but with only one use of it before the Red Ring tournament it meant deciding on the Gate or the Obelisk. On mentioning the obelisk in front of Varhoe their guide exclaimed he knew what it was!

He explained it to be a very dangerous device capable of influencing creatures through dreams. Varhoe warned them it would be difficult to destroy as it was impervious to non-magical damage, would reflect any spells cast upon it and attempts to hit it with magical weapons would reflect that damage too if it were not hit hard enough to get past its defences! A great deal of consideration was given to potential ways of disposing of it but they decided to go with RIP's plan of asking the Iron Watch to move it onto a boat and drop it out at sea. As the Warforged could not dream they would be strong enough to move it (once enhanced) and probably impervious to its malign effects. Four Iron Watch were enhanced by RIP and sent to load the obelisk onto a boat - Abel observed them dropping it out at sea via her arcane eye.

RIP used Legend Lore to discover a little more about the Cubic Gate. He learned they were created by the Cul'Sir giants and very rare. They were built around the time the giants had begun to explore those plains and they may have attracted the attention of the being from the plain of dreams that lead to the devastating war. Each side of the cube would be linked to a different plain, with one side always being Eberron. The location of the gate would be a fixed point in that plain and the Eberron locations would be somewhere on Xen'drik. Because of the strategic importance of the cubes two command words were needed to open any given gate and those were kept a closely guarded secret. The party surmised the two unreadable plaques on each face might be encoded command words but a quick check of the One-Slab keys they had so far collected did not seem to decode any of them.

One of the Iron Watch reported they'd found the body of the butler and the group went to investigate. The body had been stuffed in a brining barrel and RIP determined he'd been dead in there for at least a week. Elora cast Speak With Dead and while they struggled to think of useful questions to ask they did learn he'd been killed by someone who looked like him. The possibility of a changeling was put forward, but what would the changelings be doing with the drow? Were the drow being manipulated too? A search of the cellar turned up no hidden doors and no unexpected magical items were found in the rest of the house.

On the way to their hotel, Adrik was approached by a man offering to sell some "special meat". He discreetly asked him to meet near Southern Splendours at 22:00. Returning to the group he was less than persuasive while trying to convince Elora the man was just asking directions. Suspicious of her friend she followed him for a while before retiring to the One Good Tern.

While Abel, Elora and RIP relaxed, Adrik retired early, determined to undertake his clandestine meeting without Elora noticing. He slipped on his shiftweave and transformed it into a hooded cloak as a disguise, but absentmindedly equipping his distinct axe on his back… exiting his room he was immediately spotted by the elf, who seemingly pleased to see his shift to the shady (if not dark) side… and asked to accompany him.

At the appointed place the meat-man was waiting and offered up some freshly caught mermaid steak for 10gp. Adrik asked him to clarify the fish on top or bottom question and he answered there were both kinds - but this was from fish on top! Not wanting to be left out of the illicit shopping , Elora asked what other meats he had on offer and after thinking for a moment the man said he could get her a pair of minotaur bull eggs for 15 gp. Elora happily agreed and the two of them returned to the tavern and asked the owner to prepare them for tomorrow's breakfast.

In the morning the controversial meal was brought out and enjoyed by all, the only comment about mermaid meat being brushed off as a joke by Abel.

We will pick up next session as the group arrives at the Red Ring.
