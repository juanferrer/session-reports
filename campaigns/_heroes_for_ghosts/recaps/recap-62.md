**Start Date**: 8th Rhaan (Midday)

A lot has happened. Black Elly is now our new pilot, mostly she just wanted to remain unmarried and have lots of money, so we hit up her Uncle and surprisingly he agreed to pay her her own bounty. RIP tried to open Elly's captain's chest and got turned into a chicken for his troubles. Not too sure what happened, but there was a lot of squawking with all the chickens in the hold, and RIP seemed quite tuckered out after he changed back to himself. Never actually seen an exhausted warforged before.

We escorted the Orkan back to Stormhold, then dropped in on Control at Wroat, passing Silvercliff and Fort Light on the way. Control's office is on the 13th floor of a 12 floor building. Adrik reckons it must be a bugger getting their mail to the right place. Control wants us to take her on a diplomatic mission to Droaam - in exchange for recognition as a nation, she wants them to turn her into a changeling so she can pretend to be the Queen. It's the best bad plan we've got. C is so worried about being double crossed that she made us set a call and response - Lovely necklace - Aye aye!

While in Wroat Elora dropped in on her mum, who actually believed the whole toad licking thing was a joke. I bet Elora got away with just about anything as a kid. I finally got a lead on the locket from the fallen soldier. Adrik finished crafting his rapier and sent it to Mirele with a soppy note (actually it was rather sweet, but don't tell him I said that).

We saw on the news that an airship crashed into one of the Sharn towers. People (mostly racists) are saying the warforged did it. If that's true, how did they pilot it? Maybe there are more dragonmarked forged like RIP. Elora scryed on Sachem to make sure he wasn't busy hijacking airships, but didn't seem like it.

Anyways, we arrived at the Crag and were greeted by a harpy. Flying city watch must be pretty handy, House Cannith should think about that as a marketing idea for their brooms. The daughters were an interesting bunch, one of them is built like an ogre, one of them looks like an evil temptress from the gates of hell, and one of thems an old blind woman who probably sees more than most anyone.

Much to all of our surprise, they freely admitted the sisters were working for them all along. No apology for the multiple times their agents almost killed us, or our families, but ever so nicely asked if we'd mind awfully assassinating a dragon? They reckon Eberron, Siberys and Khyber are not dragons, but far greater beings, and the dragons are mucking up history and the prophecy and will destroy everything. To be fair, we've only got Toquill's word for everything Toquill has told us so far, and its not like the dragons have clean hands historically.

They also want us to go to the Sea of Stars, dunno why they can't just say "astral sea" like a normal person instead of trying to be all fancy, I frankly found them very annoying.

We said we'd take their requests under advisement.
