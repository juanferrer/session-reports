**Start Date**: 22nd Lharviron (Midday)
 
Having understood how the door runes work, Elora quickly slotted the correct combination into the North vault and the party took cover while she mage-handed the button. The vault opened up to a scene full of fire. On closer inspection it looked like the vault door was some sort of portal and Abel speculated it might be the plane of Fernia (The Sea of Fire). The wizard wondered if there might be a way of getting to the Astral Sea through the doors.
 
Twenty Two seemed happy with the party keeping hold of the Sphere of Annihilation (as long as they were bringing it to Sachem), but cautioned about taking it near the Overseer's area. A few options were discussed but they settled on putting it back in the vault. As the door closed the panel promptly exploded. Twenty Two was distressed by the apparent loss of a crucial item. The party assured her they would fix it.
 
Searching the bank offices they found several memo's and letters (all dated within a couple of days of the Mourning):
1. A memo from the manager briefing staff on a malfunction that had disabled their access to the east vault
2. A list of people who had items stored in the east vault
3. A sternly written letter from the manager to a Shaman Dha'iteag complaining about him keeping a Sphere of Annihilation in the north east vault and warning him he would be held responsible if they found evidence of him keeping a similar item in the now non-functioning vault.
4. A memo from the manager reminding staff they should not be taking rune stones outside the bank
 
The party decided to investigate Dha'iteag's house to see if they had another sphere of annihilation or if they could find more information about what they were doing with two of them in the first place. Twenty Two and the Reforged returned to the LR station and the party set out for the Palace of Light.
 
Starting with the south west tower the party found the Reforged had stripped out useful items from the throne room and so made their way up a level - Abel refused to take the elevator and ended up being carried up the stairs. Spotting a statue at the end of a hall of mirrors the party headed in, only to become lost in the reflections and beginning to see some of their worst fears in the mirrors. 

* Able seeing her brother and how she had imagined he might have been injured or killed in the Mourning.
* Adrik seeing his family, the disappointment of his grandfather and their faces becoming indistinguishable, unrememberable.
* Elora seeing the faces of Brelish soldiers who she had fought alongside, who she had provided intelligence on and sent to their deaths.
* RIP seeing the thousands of dead who had not been properly buried and questioned if he had done enough to send them to their rest.

With occasional moments of clarity one by one they made it to the statue; Able Dimension Doored there; Elora used detect object and followed her divining rods while keeping her eyes away from the mirrors; RIP made it there through sheer force of will (smashing mirrors along the way); Adrik had a little cry before being guided by Elora's voice and RIPs bless. The statue was found to be just that, a statue. ("Worth it" Elora 997).
 
Across the corridor the royal gallery was found. Not wanting to get sucked into any similar shenanigans to the mirrors, RIP turned each and every painting round while Adrik and Elora searched the room.
 
On the top floor they discovered the library and the queen's study. They found a report detailing how Cyre would not be able to stand against the combined onslaught now Breeland had made a truce with Thrane and they were fighting a war on five fronts. It suggested reaching out and allying with Droaam. In the library they all picked out a couple of books on subjects of interest:
- Able - Astral Sea
- Adrik - Sword Smithing
- Elora - Legends of bards and their Instruments
- RIP - Cooking
 
Making their way over to the South East tower the party found the music room. Elora eagerly tried out some of the famous instruments found there. Despite giving the best performance of her life (Performance 30) they sounded awful. Thankfully the effect seemed to be limited to the one room.
 
Descending two floor to ground level the elevator doors opened to what seemed to be a royal gala in the ballroom. The guests continued talking, dancing and drinking while paying no attention to the party moving around them. Any interaction with them seemed to have an effect but were explained away by the guests. Our heroes listened in on a number of conversations; people talking about a new super weapon they suspected the gnomes were preparing to use against Cyre; the Arch Mage's progress with his human mage-breeding program. Elora used mage hand to float the Arch Mage's hat (and toupee) across the room and into a bowl of soup. The Arch Mage stormed out of the room enraged and embarrassed. RIP tied together the shoelaces and tripped up a Cyrian commander causing more embarrassment.
 
After entertaining and helping themselves to a selection of drinks and canapés the group moved on into the banquet hall. They speculated on if their activities in the room had changed the past or if it was a closed loop. To her and everyone else's shock Elora recalled how her uncle had told her about the Queen's guard laughing at how angry the Arch Mage had been at a banquet just before he left Metrol. Apparently some joker had magicked the mage's hat and toupee off and into some soup and the crotchety old wizard had stormed out red as a beetroot! Did Elora cause that to happen in the past and so was destined to do it when she found the gala in the present day? Or did they just change the past so cause her to remember her uncle telling her the story that moments before did not exist in their timeline??! Is there a difference??? Did they cause the mourning somehow with one of these time loops??!! Our heroes suddenly had many questions about this phenomena!
 
But evening was drawing in and knowing they would not finish exploring the palace that day the party set off in search of some bedrooms. Luckily the next floor up contained the guest quarters. While checking the rooms were safe it was noticed the gaps between them were wider than they should be. Outside some arcane markings were found on the floor that Abel identified as denoting the steps needed to pass through a hidden doorway. Following them the party discovered hidden listening posts that had clearly been used to spy on the guests at the palace, complete with notes on anything seditious. The spy-stations contained bunk beds and facilities to keep their former occupants comfortable during their duties so the party settled down there for the night - safe in the knowledge no one else would find them.
 
The next morning the party moved up one level to the Royal bedrooms. More spying alcoves were found but none of them looked in on the Queen's room herself - former Trust agent Abel considered this rather amateurish! In the queen's room there were signs that she had dressed and left in a hurry one night (presumably the night of the Mourning).
 
Across on the top of the final (North West) tower our heroes first entered the War Room. A large tabled dominated the room and had on it a number of maps and briefing papers:
- Report warning of a new weapon developed by the gnomes that could deviate Cyrian defences.
- Report saying the experiments on magebreed humans by Archmage is progressing slower than expected and requests for more living prisoner or cadavers
- Report warning about the risk of Cyre being overrun now Breeland has a ceasefire with Thrane.
- Signed order authorising the deployment of twelve Warforged Colossus against Breeland, Thrane and Karnath. Hand written note saying while unmitigated fear and awe is the goal they must make sure there are some survivors to spread news of the new weapon back home
 
Finally the party headed over to the arboretum. A tower-top greenhouse containing a number of exotic plants and trees that seemed to have avoided the ill-effects suffered by other plant life - though three of the trees did seem to have become sentient and asked for some help with a fungus problem…
