**Start Date**: 24th Dravago (early afternoon)

We began with the airship departing Trollenport… Able talked to the party about her brother (Ammeron) and the party discussed the known locations of the CPADs - coming to the conclusion that at least one of them was not accounted for, in contradiction to what The Trust had said to Able. 

A copy of the Trollenport Times revealed a few stories of interest:
The front page talked about The Party being responsible for bringing the pirate Ossie Lanner to justice.
The city watch is Sharn had received some evidence from Councillor Boromar implicating the Dhask gang in the recent 'body parts in the sewers' case
House Orien has offered bounties for information on the lightning rail infrastructure in the Mournland.

The 36 hour flight proved difficult for Elora and Able and by the time they arrived (exhausted) in Zolanberg they decided to book a sleeper cabin to try and recuperate. Adrik overheard the guard reassuring passengers about recent attacks by a group of bandits in the area and tried to encourage RIP that they should decide to go after him when they got to Sterngate but RIP declined.

At Sterngate the party made some enquiries about the outlaw (Doc Ethen Karch) and learned he had apparently been a thorn in the local law enforcements side for a few years but recently brought down the wrath of House Orien after attempting to blow up a lightning rail viaduct. They also learned three of his men were being held in Groshk jail.

After the carriage ride to Groshk the party booked rooms at the Manshead tavern and asked around to see if anyone had heard of Coteh or Salmon - but no one had. Elora cast detect object to try and locate any nearby CPADs and got a hit! The party tracked the magical signal to underneath the castle in the centre of the town. While considering how to get inside they observed a goblin being dragged into the nearby sheriff's office and went to investigate. 

Speaking to the sheriff they learned there had been a few incidents where some of the town's residents had gone crazy - this particular goblin had been found out the back of his bakery, gnawing at a dead cow. Able determined the goblin was under the influence of some kind of enchantment - but as they watched that magic appeared to fade and the goblin seemed to return to normal.

Unable to determine a link the party moved on to talk to the men from Doc Ethen's gang. Under RIP's zone of truth one of them agreed to show the party his leader's hideout in exchange for his freedom. The sheriff agreed to make arrangements for him to be released into the party's custody.

While still under the zone of truth Elora asked the sheriff about the castle and local leader (Chief Grish). The sheriff seemed uneasy about speaking out against her boss but at the mention of the party's quest to seek out weapons of mass destruction hidden in her town, she agreed to help them. Sheriff Trilug advised against talking to the chief directly stating he was an untrustworthy bugbear. She told them about a secret way into the castle via a sewage outflow near the north east tower.

Not wishing to waste any time the party immediately went to the secret entrance. Shortly after making their way inside Adrik was attacked by a black-oozes-like creature with acidic blood. Though the creature was quickly killed it's acid permanently damaged Adrik's axe. 

The party overheard a conversation in an adjoining room where two individuals discussed their prisoner, the imminent arrival of 'The Sisters' and 'The Device' - the one identified as Viph explained they had some luck with powering the device but the test subjects had expired too quickly.

Using message Elora was able to locate General Nordar. The party freed her from her restraints - gaining two immovable rods in the process. The General was deeply suspicious of the party, apparently unsure if this was a ruse by the "witches". RIP did not help their standing by attempting to cast command on the General, demanding she "grovel"! Some progress was made when Able showed the General her Iron Claw medal and explained it was the party that had saved her nephew Kagen during the war. 

Nordar explained that there was a device in the dungeon that was far older than the castle - a ziggurat that was thousands of years old and extremely dangerous. She explained she had come here to destroy it but had been betrayed by Chief Grish who had held her here for several weeks - and was apparently working with some changelings witches. Nordar explain this ziggurat would be attracting terrible abominations and she would need the party to clear a path to it so she could destroy it with a weapon she had… a weapon that turned out to be a CPAD.

**End Date**: 27th Dravago (just before midnight)

**Loot**: 2 immovable rods, 4 potions of greater healing, 6 potions of healing, 3 Acid vials, 6 Poison vials and a silvered battle-axe.
