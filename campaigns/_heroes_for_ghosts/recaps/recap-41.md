**State Date**: 7th Barrakas (Evening) 

Varhoe described places of interest around Stormreach as the party descended to the town. He explained the town (and to a degree the continent) was run by five families, each headed by a Storm Lord. These families were descendants of former pirates and originally had a royal charter from the Galifar throne about 200 years ago.

**Amanatus - Militia**
(Storm Lord Yorrick Amanatus - Dwarf)
**Lassites - Trade & Exploration**
(Storm Lord Cordelia Lassites - Human)
**Omaren - Industry**
(Storm Lord Paulo Omaren - Human)
**Sel Shadras - Law**
(Storm Lord Ortor Sel Shadras - Gnome)
**Wylkes - Harbour**
(Storm Lord Jonas Wylkeses - Human)

Passing by the building owned by his family, Adrik stopped to investigate, but with no sign of activity within he resolved to return in the morning.

After showing the proprietor their Ghallanda token, free accommodation was provided at the fanciest inn in town (One Good Tern). A pleasant meal and some drinks were had. Elora had some suspicions about a couple of other patrons - but was unable to discern more.

In the morning the group returned to Caebrek & Daughter but found it still closed. RIP popped out his eyeball and sent it to scout inside, where he found the place to have been turned over in a search but apparently left unused for a couple of months. The party popped into the adventuring supplies store next door and learned that Caebrek's had been closed for a couple of months. The shopkeeper told them he'd not seen the family around but Brommar (Adrik's Cousin) might be working as a longshoreman, working off a debt to the Wylkeses (who own the building).

Outside a pegleg'd old sailor approached the party and offered to show them to old Magrus Caebrek for a few coin. Adrik offered five gold and the half-drunk man hobbled off beckoning them to follow. Elora was deeply suspicious but a detect thoughts just revealed thoughts about gin and hookers she'd rather not remember. Sadly it transpired old Magrus was dead and buried in the town cemetery. Adrik considered the loss of his grandfather and Elora offered to help, by exhuming him and either casting speak with dead!

Adrik noticed there were a few strange things about the grave. There were some runes that none of the party could read. There was a vase of freshly cut purple flowers. And the date of birth was wrong (the grave said 12th Vult but Adrik remembered it being 5th of Lharvion). Abel began the ritual that would let her read the letters and Elora attempted to scry on the person who put the flowers. The runes translated into common turned out to be gibberish and the group wondered if it might be in code. The target of Elora's scry turned out to be a goblin woman in a florist shop.

Deciding (for now) not to dig up gramps they headed into the temple to talk to the warforged priestess. They learned that Magrus's funeral had been arranged by Tishnar (Adrik's sister) and his parents (Hjuldrak and Lyesrin) had later visited the grave. The flowers were brought by a local florist (Tug).

Along the quay Adrik was reunited with Brommar and the group learned of the sizable debt he was working off for the Wylkeses. Being only moments' walk from the Wylkeses estate they attempted to visit the Storm Lord but were initially prevented from entering by the "guards", before being invited back that evening for dinner.

At the florist they discovered Tish had paid for five freshly cut Indigo Allusions to be placed on the grave once a week, with two years paid in advance. Elora recalled the flowers were known mainly for their colour, but without magical properties and Abel noted the meaning of allusion being to call something to mind without mentioning it explicitly.

After some shopping the gang set Varhoe up at the bar and headed to the dinner party in their finest outfits. Elora in her revealing shiftweave, Able in her blue dress, Adrik in his shiftweave military dress uniform and RIP put on a tie. They were greeted by Storm Lord Jonas Wylkeses himself, who was very keen to hear about their Scry show. He showed them to their rooms and bid them to come down for pre-dinner drinks and canapés when they were ready.

Downstairs they met and chatted with…
Vanatar - the surly butler
Storm Lord Cordelia Lassites
Katryl Amanatus - who flirted with Adrik
Storm Lord Ortor Sel Shadra
Lacey Omaren
