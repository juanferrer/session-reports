**Start Date**: 7th Vult --- ASTRAL-DAYS 7 (Mid-morning)
 
Soon as the last candle was lit, we reappeared in the Tikka lair, unfortunately along with the Tikka, which promptly started beating the shards out of us again. I know my people well enough to know retreat was never going to be an option, but I still had one card to play. I invoked the Second Pact on Hesanas’ contract. My companions were shocked and appalled, but I figure I ain’t long for this world anyway, and at least this way I know what comes next.
 
True to his word, Hesanas promptly sent a cadre of devils to aid us headed up by an Orthon named Gorran. With their help, we made mincemeat of the Tikka. Well, actually we made fillet steak, possibly the Bossmang will make mincemeat after we deliver it. After dispatching the Tikka, the weird guy reappeared, introduced himself as Quillan, goaded us a bit, implied that the Sisters are working for him, dropped a hint about “others” being on the way, then buggered off in a manner that suggests we are highly likely to encounter him again in the future. Adrik’s well convinced he’s one of the Lords of Dust, it seems a likely theory.
 
We returned to Sanctum and dropped off the Tikka meat. RIP negotiated for warforged citizenship, plus the Warforged use of the ship we’re going to retrieve for 100 hours. Bossmang suggested we might enquire after my brother at The Grove (a githerazai stronghold) or Eyre, where a githzerai ship has been spotted. We made some enquiries down at the port for some likely looking asteroid where the warforged could make their home, and decided on a candidate.
 
Back on BB’s ship, we headed for the asteroid to set up the portal for Saeshem, but before we could get there Adrik’s sharp eyes spotted something flickering out in the black. Using my mask I could see some kinda weird looking space fish, which when I asked BB about it, he promptly had a massive panic attack and hit the alarm. Evidently this is a space-drow attack vessel; two of them as it turned out. We managed to outrun one of them, and disabled the other one thanks to some precision shooting and fancy high-G manoeuvres (great for my skin, not so much for my belly!)
 
We decided to board them, Adrik very much of the view that we should have a lovely chat, but rather than the cup of tea he seemed to be expecting we were greeted with a fireball!
