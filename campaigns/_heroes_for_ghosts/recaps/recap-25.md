**Start Date**: 14th Lharvion (Morning) 
 
Final preparation were made for the conclave. The party agreed with Chervian d'Ghallanda that the House would provide asylum for Calla d'Jorasco providing the conclave found in their favour. They recruited a local alchemist from the Heavy Cauldron to act as an expert witness.
 
A visit was made to Calla. The doctor reluctantly agreed to the testimony deal as she felt she had little choice but to put her faith in them winning. Concerned for her state of mind, a suicide watch was set for her, with Able taking first shift.
 
On their way back to their hotel the party encountered a man hawking "official" Scry-News Fighting with Dinosaurs merchandise. Elora confiscated a joke book allegedly containing her jokes. Adrik eagerly purchased a toy replica of his axe. RIP was disgusted to find the eyeballs on sale were stale!
 
RIP presented Able with the pipe of smoke monster as a token of gratitude for her recent brush with death. Able was delighted and touched by the gesture.
 
The morning of the Conclave arrived. Able made the opening statement for the prosecution. Followed by an impassioned speech from RIP about the abuses of power of nations and of dragon marked houses. About how the commoners were always the victims and often their death went unmarked and their graves unnamed. A speech in which we learned of his great sadness at the nameless bodies he had buried during the war. And how he had returned when freed to exhume them from their mass graves and intern all five thousand, three hundred and twenty five in marked graves. It had a rousing effect on the crowd and set the tone for the trial.
 
One by one solid arguments were made by the prosecution. One by one the defence failed to counter. In a last ditch effort the defence brought Elora to the stand; using her real name and attempting to drag up her past publicly, but were shut down with objections from the prosecution.
 
The outcome was a resounding win for the prosecution. Four out of four charges successfully proven the Panchayat (Judges) took only a few minutes deliberation before handing down this judgment:
 
House Jorasco is barred from the plains. They are ordered to pay a year's salary to all surviving workers (326,880 gold / 720 each ) and 5 years' salary to the family of any who died (709,200 gold / 3600 each). If no such family is found then the funds will be paid to charities working with living refugees. They must turn the land over to the workers who will be given citizenship if they wish to remain. House Jorasco is ordered to pay the party who uncovered their crimes 2000g compensation. 
 
After speaking on their behalf Calla and Mr Copperkettle were sentenced to five years' service providing medical care to the settlers, under the supervision of Lath Sharbul.
 
Returning to their hotel the party found the half-elven woman C (Control) waiting for them. She clearly had worked out the famous four from Scry's Fighting With Dinosaurs were the party. She expressed disbelief that their uncanny ability to stumble on plots and conspiracies were blind luck. She wanted to know who they were working for. She wanted to know "who is Mr Toquill?"
 
**End Date**: 15th Lharvion (Evening)

**Loot**: 500g each compensation.
