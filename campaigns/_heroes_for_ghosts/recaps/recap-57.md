**Start Date**: 3rd Rhaan (Just before dinner)

We took the Khyber tunnels to Verdant. Adrik experimented with his new poisoners kit along the way, it didn't go very well but he didn't blow anything up and he managed a basic poison at least which is actually not bad for a beginner. If we get back to Starilaskur any time soon I will get Brella to give him some tips.

Varhoe had this model of Verdant which he talked us through the key tourist locations. On the last night before we went out, RIP created this real eerie temple for us to rest in, we had to sleep in coffins which I hope was not a portent for the coming battle. I slept great due to the huge and delicious Heroes Feast which RIP provided to fortify us.

In the morning Adrik used the comfy cushion to scout around, and we decided to sneak over to the Henge to get some extra planar magic. I guess in his scouting he missed the huge pit we had to climb down into, but at least he went first so he had to deal with the tentacley burrowing thing that tried to nom him. After a couple of swipes from Adrik, that creature scuttled right back into the dirt. RIP and I were more of a danger to ourselves than that creature ever was as we nearly killed ourselves climbing down.

We ran into a small group of Drows at the Henge, and RIP killed one with Severance which activated its first magic which along with his primal scream gave me quite a turn. Brlien the Fearless also killed one and we quickly dealt with the rest.

After activating our chosen Hedge powers, Elora sneaked ahead to check out the Ziggurat situation, and found all three witches along with a couple of giants and Tishnar bound to some kind of weird Cul'Sir metal pillar. Seeing no easy way to surprise our enemies, Elora messaged them to basically say "put the kettle on, we'll be there in five". When we reached the top, they demanded we hand over the artifacts before they would release Tishnar. Then RIP cast Firestorm, so negotiations kinda broke down at that point.

Saloman pretty much ruined me by casting a spell which made my very worst bad-arthritis-in-a-thunderstorm-day seem like a picnic, making it real hard to focus enough to cast any spells. But then Elora used a new spell, Force Cage, to imprison Saloman and take her out of the fight, and the rage on that bitch's face just about made the pain bearable.

We managed to kill what we thought was Coteth, but then her corpse turned into a drow, so we don't really know if that was her, but probably not. Brlien the Fearless died a splattery but heroic death. With everyone but me dishing out the damage, Mahari attempted to flee but got stuck in a cloud of insects, and RIP got grappled in a smelly Hill Giant armpit, so while I think we are up in the last quarter right now I guess its still anyone's gameâ€¦.
