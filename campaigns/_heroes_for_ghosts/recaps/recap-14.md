**Start Date**: 9th Nymm (evening)
 
The remainder of the journey to Starilaskur passed uneventfully on the carriage. On arrival Able announced her plans to visit an old friend who ran an alchemist shop in the town. Brellacaine For The Soul run by the gnome Brellacaine Beldar Bramblewurst. On the way to the shop the party declined to help a woman (Kailee) asking to borrow some to get a ticket to Xandrar. Elora did buy her a hot drink however, for which Kailee gratefully gave the elf a hug… Elora was suspicious of the woman and checked her pockets only to find she had pickpocketed one of the immovable rods! The grifter was chased down and the rod retrieved. 
 
Arriving at the shop Able was touched to see it had been renamed Caine and Able's (a name the locals had started to call it after Able had worked there for several months). Inside she was reunited with her old friend but learned business was not doing well after a warforged (Mix) had set up shop a few streets down and was undercutting her with his rather moreish potions.
 
At the Moon Sugar Alembic Elora unsuccessfully tried to scout out the back of the shop(forgetting she had left behind her roguish past) before giving up and going to talk to the barkeep in the tavern next to the shop. Not a lot of useful information was gained but the trip was worth it if only to meet the morbidly obese elf running the bar. 
 
After some investigation the party suspected Mix was putting something addictive in his health potions. They found Kailee trying to score some potions on credit, along with a number of other customers who were using the potions daily without any apparent need. Able purchased a couple of potions (with receipt) and took them back to Brella for analysis. 
She was able to determine there was another substance there but not what it was (despite Elora trying it).
 
RIP cast Detect Poison and Disease and learned the potions were cut with Tenebris-Accipit (street name Tar Beast) a narcotic known for its temporary ability to boost a person's health but at a high chance of addition that leads to exhaustion and death they do not continue to take it.
 
After a debate as to whether they should take it to House Jorsaco, or the local Watch, or deal with it themselves they plumped for the former. They took both the addict Kailee and the remaining contaminated potions to the local Joraso clinic. Able made as much a scene as possible in the public reception area as th he scandal. Dr Appleblossom reassured the party the house had no knowledge of what Mix had been doing and The House would put a stop to it immediately. He dispatched a group of house guards to investigate and arrest the alchemist.
 
After a nights rest at The Droaam Roamer the party continued their journey to Aruldusk with a short shop at the now heavily fortified town of Vathirond. The town had erected 30ft walls to protect it from the creatures that sometimes made their way out of the nearby Mournland. From the top of the walls some of the party members were able to see, for the first time in a couple of years, the fog wall that shrouded the former county of Cyre. On the platform they met a mercenary who had recently returned from the Mournland after losing the other three members of his party there.
 
Onward and over the border into Thrane a few more hours were spent on the lightning rail before arriving late evening in the capital of Flamekeep. Rooms were purchased and a few drinks were had. They learned some gossip that Underkepper Gregor Mantanye was after his bosses job and bedded down ready for an early start to a day of research in the Great Library the next day. 
 
Access to the library proved to be a bit difficult - with a lengthy application process for membership… but access was eventually negotiated in exchange for dealing with some Nothics that had infested the stacks.
 
**End Date**: 13th Nymm (early morning)

**Loot**: A jar or restorative ointment and a potion of spell recovery
