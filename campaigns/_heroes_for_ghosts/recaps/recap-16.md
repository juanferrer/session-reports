With the surprise arrival of a Kobold, Goblin and Orc in their cabin - along with a Frost Giant hanging from the side of the train the party prepared for combat. Elora quickly realised she had some control over the Kobold that had appeared from her card and instructed it to attack the goblin. The orc commented on the pleasant environment and was offered a bottle of brandy by Able - which fell through his apparently incorporeal body. Most of the party began to realise the four interlopers might not be real, with the exception of the imperceptive Adrik who tried to offer the Giant some food though the open window.
 
A ticket inspector was dissuaded from entering after being told the entire party was naked and the giant was persuaded to climb onto the roof of the train as the party heard another locomotive approaching down the parallel track. Adrik picked up his giant card and went in search of the being but found no sign of it on the roof and concluded it may have been knocked off. Another card was picked up and it was noticed the Orc vanished… before dismissing the rest Adrik asked the bloodied kobold and goblin if their injuries were painful - they replied they were "extremely painful" and the dwarf considered the morals of using the cards.	After some further time spent examining the cards however Adrik concluded it was a deck of illusions and the creatures were not real. They also learnt that once dealt the cards could not be used again.
 
At midnight RIP tried his usual trick with his (swapped out) horn at the same time Elora used the real one to play him a tune. Realizing he had been duped he disposed of the normal instrument out of the window. During a brief stop at Vedykar RIP used locate object to find his real horn was in Elora's bag and eventually retrieved it.
 
Arriving in Gatherhold the party sought directions from a couple of town guards who they learned were called The Rakshak - though Elora repeatedly pretended to think that was their personal names much to their annoyance. Fluent in Halfling she was also able to understand their private conversation about getting a "Donation" for the Rakshak retirement fund. With directions acquired Elora tried to pet one of the Clawfoot dinosaur mounts, causing it to throw its rider much to his colleagues' amusement.
 
Making their way across town the party tried to explain "retirement" to RIP before they stopped in at the House Jorasco clinic in search of information about Meriele and the other settlers. The search was in vain however as they ran into an officious house officer who delayed them with paperwork and red tape before Dr Cayla d'Jorasco was summoned and refused to divulge Meriele's location.
 
Retreating to the hotel Able got some information from the bartender; he explained the hotel was the headquarters of House Ghallanda and that while his house and Jorasco both originated on the Plains there was little love for Jorasco after they moved to Karrnath during The Last War. He told Elora he thought he'd seen her sister a few weeks ago and advised they seek a guide at the Jaaver Souk (animal market).
 
To the delight of the party the Jaaver Souk was full of domesticated dinosaurs for sale. The party met a strange and bombastic person who they soon came to know as Sas (Saseth Ciladan) the egg collector. It was revealed the masked and cloaked Sas was a member of a race seldom seen throughout Khorvaire - a Lizard folk from the jungled nation of Q'Barra in the east. Sas agreed to guide the party in the Plains in exchange for some help with his egg collecting… and he helped them purchase some mounts.
 
As evening approached the party scouted out the clinic from the hotel balcony before attempting to infiltrate in search of information on Meriele. Able ate her fill of steamed Jhaalar before being escorted to the clinic by Adrik as she feigned stomach problems. RIP was left on lookout while Elora and Sas sneaked into the administration wing. Able used mage hand to tickle her throat causing her to vomit over the nurse buying the rest of the party some time. Elora and Sas made their way to Dr Cayla office and discovered her safe. RIP spotted the doctor returning to the clinic and cast create food and drink on the steps of the main entrance - making it look like vomit - delaying the doctor as she sought another entrance. Elora worked out two of the numbers needed to open the safe and began trying all combinations to get the third. Abel and Adrik further delayed the nurse with another round of vomiting and RIP sent a message telling them to get out. Using the tomb of devouring Elora took the information on Project Blue Hand and her sisters location from the paperwork in the safe and fled with Sas, failing to clear the fake vomit at the entrance and getting covered in it.
 
Back at the hotel and cleaned up the party went over the evidence and Sad confirmed he knew where Dakshin (aka Lostflats) was and preparations were made for their morning departure.
 
A few hours into their ride east we finished our session as the party failed to sneak past what Sas thought might be a group of predators laying in ambush…
 
**End Date**: 17th Nymm (late afternoon)
