**Start Date**: 7th Sypheros --- ASTRAL-DAYS 2 (Evening)

We only needed to hold out against the grichlich for long enough to refine 12kg of fuel. Adrik dealt with a little one, while Elora turned the big one into a lamb, which we debated ejecting from the station. RIP decided offence was the better part of valour and went after the lamb, which turned back into the big ugly thing and smashed its way into the room. Figuring on finishing the fight quickly, I disintegrated the creature and went back to refining. Elora got bored fast and went exploring, unfortunately finding out that the big nasty creature wasn't all that big and nasty compared to its mum. Elora received her usual reward for exploration (grievous bodily harm), but saved the day by imprisoning grichlich mum in a forcecage.

After we refined enough fuel with a bit for spare, we headed on to Sancus Station, which was in an asteroid that looked like someone plonked a jungle on it. Adrik seemed a bit mystified by the concept of plants in space. We did some shopping, Adrik bought some green meat for RIP to cook, and I bought a pretty birdy which is going to be the start of my new import/export business - Astral Sea Shipping. Mostly I just can't wait to see the shipping crate stamps - Property of ASS, Fragile ASS, ASS - This way up, Time sensitive ASS. It's gonna be great.

We got introduced to the Bossman of the station who explained he has been caring for the refugees of "our kind" out of nothing more than the goodness of his heart and (apparently) the hope that eventually some adventurers would turn up and go hunt some special meat for him. He said that a bunch of the refugees stole one of his spaceboats, and he'd also quite like us to get the boat back and send all the refugees back to where they came from. He actually seems much more concerned about the meat than the boat, space priorities seem a bit whack.

When we finally had a chance to speak to the refugees, we discovered that Ammeron (my brother) was in fact leading the group that stole the ship. I guess he had some high profile prisoner he was responsible for when they set off the CPADs, and said prisoner got recovered by the Githzerai, so Ammy's gone off to find him. When I find that boy I am going to give his ear such a tweaking.

We did also find out that they set off the CPAD in response to the Mourning Event, so at least Ammy wasn't responsible for glassing an entire nation, that's a relief.

There was a sudden concern among the party that the high value prisoner might be Elora's father who vanished during the Mourning. Elora attempted to scry for her father, with no result.

We sent home the refugees who haven't gone off on some idiotic crusade, and then set off to Olraune to hunt the chicken tikka for the bossman.
