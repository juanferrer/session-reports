**Start Date**: 19th Barrakas (Late Morning)

The party barely had time to catch their breath after the fight, before having to deal with their camera man being held hostage. Tishnar (Tish / Tishy) Caebrek had grabbed the gnome and with a wand held to his temple, was threatening to kill him unless everyone lowered their weapons. Adjugated and confused, she refused to believe Adrik was real - stating their grandfather had told them he died after running away to fight in the war. She insisted he was another of shapeshifters tricks. It wasn't looking good for Pan until Adrik was able to win her round by singing a song from their childhood.

With the situation diffused Tish spoke about what had been happening… A few months ago she had discovered how to unlock some of the clues to major Cul'sir ruins. Their grandfather had passed away and their parents were away, but she wanted to waste no time in investigating the discovery; so she left a clue only her parents would understand and set out for Indigo. She had been at the site for a few weeks and had concluded it was some kind of power source for the giants' Khyber travel network when the drow arrived. Having no chance in a fight with them she hid and watched. The drow seemed to be trying to do the same thing she was; trying to activate the machine.

Having decoded the clue on the grave their parents arrived and were immediately captured by the drow. But after failing to get useful information out of them the drow leader ordered them to be taken to Amber. Continuing to watch the dark elves, Tish learned there were three Changelings leading them (Salmon, Coteh and Mahari) and wondered how much their Drow followers knew about them. The party questioned when she had last seen them, as they believed Coteh (at least) had been killed at the ziggurat! Tish confirmed she'd seen all three in the past few days.

The party rested for an hour as Tish and Adrik caught up. He learned Magrus had insisted Adrik had been killed in the war and even produced a letter confirming it. She said their parents were alive (at least recently) and so was Brommar; and the party realised they had forgotten about the indentured dwarf in their rush to leave Stormreach, but vowed to free him on their return.

Adrik tried on the power armour and questioned Lacey about activating its powers. The heiress described how after being captured the drow had brought her to Indigo and forced her to help unlock the power armour. She said they were also after three other "Tools of the Cul'Sir" at places called Aqua, Cadmium, and Verdant (A ocular device, an instrument and a shield). Tish explained how she believed activating the core of the Indigo facility would open up routes to those sites. She said the drow had tried to activate it, but failed, and given the limited attempts allowed had paused while they researched it further. She said they lacked the ability to see the key and handed out a concoction made from Syberis shard powder to help.

Connecting themselves up to the 'VR' interface with the core the party found themselves projected into a weird pocket dimension. There were only five attempts at reactivating the core remaining. After burning through the first three attempts they figured out the puzzle behind the 'Chromatic Calculator' was to add or subtract colours (really the clue was in the name guys). Nervously they navigated the second to last core through the maze and activated the facility. Not wishing to lose time they set off through the tunnels, following the amber and light blue lights towards Henge.

Not long after their long rest they spotted light at the end of the tunnel and Elora was sent to scout. She returned a short while later reporting several giants ahead at an outdoor station. From the description Varhoe suggested they were probably stone giants and joined Elora on another reconnoitre to see what they could discover… he overheard them discussing the recent opening of the tunnels and what it meant for their religion. The guide informed the party the stone giants were fanatically religious, believing the world was a dream from which they must wake. It seemed they had taken the recent change in their environment as a portent of "The Awakening" and would likely be looking for honourable ways to die so they could leave the dreamworld.

The standard plan of climbing on each other's shoulders while wearing a giant sized coat was floated and eliminated (only because they found they did not have a giant sized coat). Instead they opted for using seaming to transform them into "children of the corn esque" stone giant children who would go tell the giants how to find their awakening (by killing themselves). Varhoe being the only giant speaker was carefully coached in what to say, the spell was cast and they set off with RIP providing sound effects.

It started well and all was going swimmingly. The first giant encountered was fully ready to accept his rapture. The leader was a little more sceptical and wanted to know how going to the lightning room in Indigo would help awaken them. Abel tried to assist Varhoe with the response and drew attention to her spell casting. Seeing their plan was about to go south, she cast dominate person on the leader and told him to take his people to Indigo. The storm giants all marched off and the party congratulated themselves on a plan well executed… until Abel remembered they only had one minute before the spell wore off!

Our heroes quickly readied themselves for battle and Abel commanded the leader to tell his followers "The awakening is within! We must fight each other". Only two of the giants realised this was bullshit and ran back towards the party, while the other five began beating the crap out of each other. The first to make it back to Henge was met by E-Rex, mouth-grappled by the head and dumped in the lava. The second got wrecked by a multitude of held spells. By the time the leader had managed to persuade the remaining giants they had been tricked it was too late. They had killed or injured each other so much they were easy pickings for the party when they limped back to the station.

With seven giants sent off to their awakening, the party turned to inspect The Henge.
