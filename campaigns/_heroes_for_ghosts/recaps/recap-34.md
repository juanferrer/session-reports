**Start Date**: 25th Lharviron (Early Afternoon)
 
With the attackers dispatched the party set about investigating the corpses. Elora struggled to identify the dragon marks but her mother knew who they were. The Mark of Shadow, known to be associated with House Phiarlan (an elfish and possibly the oldest house) and House Thuranni (split from Phiarlan towards the end of the Last War). Both houses were publicly known as houses of actors and entertainers - but Shava explained their real business was as spies and assassins to the Eberron elite. 
 
A search of their bodies by Adrik and RIP showed they had suicide capsules built into their molars. Adrik retrieved one for later use or study. There was no sign of which of the two houses they were from or who had hired them
 
Talking over the previous day's Mourning Glory broadcast with Pan it was reasoned the attackers probably knew they were planning on heading out the Mournland by lighting rail and had lay in ambush. The party figured they must also have had a way of transporting the petrified queen if they'd captured her. Abel tried searching with arcane eye without success, so Elora took the Broom out. She found they were near the road and there was a large cart stowed nearby.
 
Slowly moving to the bridge they found it as they had left it and debated how to get the queen across. Shava recalled there might be controls in the central tower. Elora set off on the broom to investigate. She found some dead guards (some preserved and some decomposed) along with some cannons and a keg of black powder. Hearing the rumbling of possible machinery below the elf headed down below the deck of the bridge to find a control room with a couple of arcane machines. One machine was off - the other malfunctioning. While inspecting the inactive machine she was attacked by a hidden earth elemental that had apparently broken loose of the dragon shard powering the machine. Elora was badly injured by the first blow so Able (who had been watching with arcane eye) alerted the party and dimension doored to her aid. Fortunately Elora was able to fear the creature and buy them a few seconds to figure out what to do.
 
A scroll of planar binding was found in a cabinet labelled 'break glass in case of emergency'. Abel took a moment to consider how useful and valuable the level five scroll was before using it on the elemental and sending it back into the shard. Meanwhile Adrik and RIP were trying to catch up to help. Pan who was also left behind got a super cool shot of the dwarf recalling the Broom and leaping onto it mid-flight. Abel and Elora inspected the machines and tried reinserting the shard into the inactive one; this caused the western span to rematerialize. The other machine seemed to have a damaged crystal in it. After some debate about 'not repeating the SOA incident' they tried the working shard in the eastern machine and restored that span. Returning to the train they gathered up the guard, queen and cart and slowly moved them across the bridge, leaving the Reforged Adviser to guard the train.
 
There was a great deal of activity across the bridge. Two airships and a Lightning rail train waiting for the party. First on the list of meetings was Lysee, who after welcoming them back (with drinks and cookies) asked to look at the Prophetic Epidiascope. She spoke at length about something called the Draconic Prophecy. It was apparently discovered or written by the Dragons of Argonnessen and was thought to foretell events on Eberron. Despite a lifetime of trying to study the prophecy Lysee had to concede it was beyond the comprehension of anyone but the dragons. She inspected RIPs mark and confessed she did not know what it was. While the other 12/13 marks had appeared on other races over the past several thousand years none had been on Warforged, but they had only existed for a couple of decades so perhaps he was the first. She urged him to keep it hidden from the other houses for now, saying she would make sure it was not shown on Scry. Rumours of the lightning rail being driven by a rogue Orien agent had been spreading and had been encouraged by Sivis.
 
Next up was Control, who had come with the thanks of King Boranel for rescuing his cousin. C had an offer to take the queen back to Breeland where she could be healed and reunited with her son at New Cyre. Deeply suspicious of this the party quizzed her on Breelands motives and the possibility of using her to gain control of weapons of mass destruction. She of course deigned this. Control talked about the frustration of trying to track down Toquill. She thanked them for the tipoff about his house and said they had found several high grade military weapons there but had failed to locate the man himself.
 
Chief Sharbul was next in line; He had come from Gatherhold to categorically state they did not want the queen in the Talenta Plains! The chiefs feared being caught between Breeland and Karrnath if she remained and so urged them to send her to one of them as soon as possible.
 
The meeting with the delegation sent by King Kaius (Colonel Hellekanus) went less than well. The Colonel thanked the party on behalf of the King of Karrnath and asked them to let him take her back to Korth where she could receive the finest medical treatment and be kept safe by her cousin Kraius III. He expressed regret at hearing of the attack on the party by assassins (allegedly) hired by Breeland and made an offer to smooth over relations between the party and House Jorasco. However after taking an instant dislike to the man it seemed unlikely they would choose this option.
 
Finally the party met with house Cannith. Head of Cannith East (Zorlan d'Cannith) along with lawyers representing the heads of West and South. Zorlan had no interest in the queen and only wanted to talk about the Broom. The house knew the rouse about a gift from the gods was nonsense. Elora launched into a speech about what great advertising they were providing, when Zorlan agreed… he only wanted to inspect the device and have the plans so they could build more. Zorlan confessed to being a huge fan of their show and eagerly produced a fighting with dinosaurs and Mourning Glory t-shirt for them to sign. RIP persuaded him to see about providing more Brooms for the party once they had production up and running. More cookies, wine and whisky was provided…
 
RIP asked about the Warforged Titans that Cannith built for Cyre. Zorlan explained there were thirteen produced and they were presumed to be scattered over the Mournland. They needed at least four pilots to operate and had no real intelligence of their own. As for destroying them - they were powered by dragon shards but would need large sections to be destroyed (possibly by some sort of disintegration or vortex weapon) to fully disable them. He also disclosed Cannith had not been paid for them and the Cyrean government owed the house several million gold by end of the war. He could not help with the locations but said they could probably find that in the Palace of Flame.
 
Returning to the Queen's Guard Elora explained the situation to her mother. The choice between Breeland and Karrnath did not seem appealing and they considered returning to the Mournland and refuge with the Reforged. The party decided to have one last conversation with Control. They expressed their concern that the Queen was being sought as a means to access weapons in the Mournland. The spy chief privately told them she would have preferred the queen had not been brought out or revived and offered an alternative; a block of stone and Abel's stone-shape to create a facsimile of the petrified queen. If the party agreed she would drop the real queen into Kraken bay as they flew home. The attempts to revive the queen would fail in Breland but no one would know why. Reluctantly they agreed after asking to scry on her when she dropped the Queen overboard and for the last known locations of any Titans and CPADs.
- Brelish intelligence indicated there was a titan west of Kalazart that was to be used on Vathirond other locations may be found in Palace of Flame
- Three CPADs were lost or detonated in the Mourning
 - Renfort - Lt. Ammeron Adredar (presumed detonated)
 - Barren Keep - Lt. Jotra Munggen (unknown)
 - Rockfort - Lt. Valpos Humple (unknown)
 
 
 
Abel performed the stone-shape and the real queen was loaded onto Control's airship. Elora said her farewells to her mother and the party set off for the bridge. Back at the train Elora announced she wanted to try and scry on Toquill and Abel relayed her theory that their patron was really a dragon! Using the crystal ball they had retrieved from student project display in the Place of Storms Elora tried but failed to scry on Toquill - but she did become convinced RIP was coming onto her!...
