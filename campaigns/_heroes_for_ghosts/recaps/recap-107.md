Summoned by Sora Katra, we arrive at the Great Crag to find the entire dragon council assembled in the throne room. The atmosphere is a little awkward, but then they all shapeshift into their natural formsâ€¦ including the Daughters, who it turns out are actually Couatl, and cousins of sorts to the dragons. RIP presents the Daughters with the trophy heads collected thus far, and promises to complete the set. The Daughters give us the unveiling book of Vral'a'yak and the key to the machine room. They informed us that even now, the Dael'kyr are preparing a ritual to summon or create a new Dael'kyr, and urged us to make haste to put a stop to it. One more would allow them to make changes, and it might become impossible to stop them at that point.

Belora requested to join the Chamber of dragons after the fighting was done, and Toquil promised the request would be given due consideration. The Daughters promised us there would be a party to attend after the battle was won.  We prepared ourselves for the fight of our lives (everybody's lives really!), and with Elora's help Abel told the Ballad of Sweetie, a half-orc foundling who rose to gladiatorial greatness. On finding herself appearing before the heroes of Mourning Glory, Sweetie was quite starstruck, and was glad to join them in the glorious challenge of battling the Dael'kyr.

Travelling back to the asylum, we quickly dispatched with the orderlies on the way to the machine room, and after a brief conversation with the Librarian in which we totally failed to convince him to give us Quillion's book of unveiling, we stepped into the machine room ritual chamber. We could see machines emitting different coloured beams of energy which were coalescing into the form of a new Dael'kyr in the centre - it was very apparent that the ritual was almost complete.

Quillion and Vral'a'yak awaited us, and once Quillion finished an excellent speech, the battle began. At first it seemed that destroying the machines would be the best plan, and Sweetie quickly smashed one of them. It seemed to have some effect, but did not interrupt the ritual. With the distance between each machine, destroying them all quickly didn't seem possible, so instead we focussed on destroying the Dael'kyr, which was also no easy task.

We gradually managed to whittle down Quillion, but meanwhile Sweetie was imprisoned in a force cage and Adrik was taking quite a beating. Then a wild magic surge gave Vral'a'yak the ability to immediately revive on death, which could mean if we did not stop the ritual in time, we might end up having to fight her twice, along with the two others! Just as time was almost up, Adrik swung the killing blow against Quillion, but as he did so the Dael'kyr summoned the last of his magic and felled Elora with Power Word Kill. Abel rejoined the fight, but still needed to free herself of the force cage. Adrik was seriously injured, Elora was dead, and it seemed likely we would have to fight Vral'a'yak twice over. We needed a miracle. 

In that moment of despair RIP cried out to his divinity, and his prayer to restore Elora to life was granted. Abel disintegrated the forcecage, Adrik was infused with a nice big healing spell, and we attacked Vral'a'yak with renewed vigor. As her wounds became mortal, Abel finished her with Disintegrate to prevent her from reincarnating.  We had our victory, but at a terrible cost - with Vral'a'yak disintegrated, it was now impossible to complete the Dael'kyr heads collection.

Turning our attention to the unveiling ritual, we repaired the machine that Sweetie had smashed, and together chose the future fate of Eberron:

- Restore life to Cyre
- Better travel between Eberron and the Astral Sea
- Restore Xoriat to what it was supposed to be
- Remove the effects of the Mourning from Cyre
- Allow the warforged to reproduce
 

We completed the ritual, and nothing exploded. On leaving the chamber, we found things had changed. Xoriat was now a tranquil place, run by the former inmates, who seemed happy and at peace. We kept our promise to the Librarian, and returned the books of unveiling, impressing upon him their dangerous nature and the need for him to keep them safe.

Returning to Eberron, we decided to go straight to Metrol, to see how effective the ritual had been. We found a city in ruins, overgrown and home to nothing but wildlife, but no longer under the shroud of the Mourning. No doubt restoring Cyre will take a lot of work, but at least now it is a possibility. The party spend their victory evening peacefully in Metrol. On awakening the next day, the party discover that Abel has passed away in her sleep, leaving behind an invitation to the party to attend her wake at the Hellcienda in Daanvi.
