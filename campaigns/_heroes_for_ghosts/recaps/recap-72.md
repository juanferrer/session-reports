**Start Date**: 10th Zarantry (Early morning)

Over a well-earned drink at the new tavern at the Cannith encampment, Mero explained that his team were tasked with intercepting one of the new Cyrean secret weapons - AKA the colossus. One of his team, Mohim (AKA Elora's father), sold them out to the Cyreans and faked his own death. Mero tracked him down in the astral sea, but was attacked by the squids. Silaris' people (the Githzerai) saved them, and informed them that they had Mohim and were attempting to return him to his people. Then they were all attacked by more squids.

In the meantime evidently Mohim had managed to make a new deal with Quillon, who it turns out is one of four Outsider prisoners that the Githzerai have been holding. They can be killed, but just return after they die, hence why they are being held prisoner.

Mero also gave us a list of all 13 colossus which were reported to exist, and where they were stationed and targeted. RIP sent the list to Toquil. RIP freed Cutlass (the warforged we reduced from the Giff). Elora and Adrik both wrote letters to Miriele (Adrik's letter was rather more coherent). We arranged to meet BB back on the asteroid in 30 days Eberron time (3 days Astral time).

Elly left us a rather cryptic puzzle which turned out to be the code for a teleportation circle in the Deep Mara Cavern. On travelling there we discovered she has spent the last 6 months plundering illegal pirates (at least we hope they were all illegal) and her booty included 26 spheres of annihilation.

We packed (4? 5?) SoAs on the airship and headed out for Rhukaan Draal, experimenting along the way to see if we can destroy the SoAs by colliding them. Its ever so slightly dangerous, but it does work.

We received a letter back from Miriele, indicating that Karrnath may be eyeing up the Talenta Plains as a new improved war target.

In Rhukaan Draal we were greeted by a Kec'Serrat officer named Mored, who remembered us from when we encountered General Nordar. He gave us some pretty thorough information about the Outsiders, who they call the Daelkyr. They came from Xorat 9000 years ago, at the same time as the Githzerai, but are likely to have origins elsewhere. They possess godlike powers. There were 7 in total (at least that are known about), but it is thought that only their Avatars came to Eberron, which is presumably why they can't be killed. They are:

- Xos - imprisoned somewhere under the Demon Wastes, exact location unknown
- Jedra - in a Khyber cavern under Western Karnwood, Karrnath (near the ice castle)
- Vasstar - under Karthoon Tor, Droaam
- The githzerai have:
- Vral'a'yak
- Riman
- Xanin
- Quillon (though it seems he might be at least partially free?!)
