**Start Date**: 1st Zarantry --- ASTRAL-DAYS 9 (Mid-morning)

Well, I did try to get the Space Drow to surrender, but didn't think to ask them in a language they understood, so we just murderised them instead and RIP took an interesting sword from one of their corpses.

Elora used speak with dead to interrogate one of them, and managed to get out of him that another gnome was on "Pasath", located near Eyre. Also found out his boss's name is Sarrak. RIP used Severance on the sword he'd taken, and unlocked a new trait for the scythe to absorb magic abilities.

BB promised us 50% of the salvage value of the ship, if we finished the job of "killing it". Turns out the weird pod we saw in the ship houses the ship's brain, which seems to be a space drow kinda hooked in somehow. Wish I had more time to study it.

The next morning with the space drow ship in tow, we got hit by a dead Githzerai asteroid. We'd found some kind of debris field from a space-sea battle. BB told us the pirates have gone a bit more piratey since the Lharvion incident. I'm very worried about Mero if they have him, and asked Elora to scry on him, but she was somehow repelled or pushed back.

Pan stepped back home briefly to drop off tapes and brought us back the latest news:
- Varhoe got himself a new celebrity travel show
- Queen Darnell (not) has given the Glass Plateau to the Reforged. Not everyone's real happy with that, particularly Karnath who sent a bunch of troops into the Mournland to argue. They didn't come back, but Sachem did announce that he'll march north if anyone walks on his grass again.
- Droam got their recognition from King Boranel.

We stopped off at Asteroid 134M-blah-blah and set up the teleport circle for Sachem. He sent 22 through with a small group to start scouting and setting up. Was nice to see 22 again, though we did get confirmation that the Karnath contingent was destroyed by the Colossus. Worrying, but I guess I can't really blame them.

Back to the ship, and we followed the debris back to its source… some mighty impressive ships remained locked in a sort of battle. It appeared the space drow ship was eating the corpse of the Githzerai ship. I was in favour of using our captured space drow ship to get on board, but BB suggested a MUCH SAFER plan of silently coasting past close enough for us to jump. Why is our preferred plan always the utterly mad one?

Anyway, it worked, and we got ourselves on board. I used Seeming to disguise us as space drow and cast Tongues on Elora, so she will be doing all our talking I guess. What could possibly go wrong? To be fair, she talked us past one guard who was a bit suspicious about my height… something about bring your child to work day. The cheek!

We located the prisoners, but the guard there was a bit more savvy and RIP used silence to cover the noise of Adrik taking him out. I searched the cells, but only found one of Mero's crew, who said Mero was taken away for interrogation. We freed all the prisoners, and as I despaired of how to find my brother, Elora by happy luck flung open the door to what turned out to be the interrogation room. Unhappily, it revealed Mero being tortured by two mindflayers.
