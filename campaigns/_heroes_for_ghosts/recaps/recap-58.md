Things weren't going too bad, until Salomon showed us a use for Disintegrate that I didn't know about, dissolving the bars of the Force Cage. I failed to notice the drow sneaking up on me, and one of them gave me a good conk on the noggin. As I went down, I saw Elora being enveloped in a magical sphere, trapping her out of the fight.

Next thing I know I'm floating above my body which is slowly bleeding out below me. I could see RIP and Adrik trying to make a comeback - RIP cast silence on Salomon and Adrik started wailing on her with mighty blows from his axe. Elora used polymorph, which was a risky but ultimately epic move as E-Rex burst out of that bubble like some massive angry scaly baby hatching out of an invisible egg.

Adrik vanished, which I thought was a good trick until I realised it was more "banish" than "vanish". E-Rex managed to do enough damage to interrupt the banish so Adrik could pop back in, but then her concentration got interrupted, and then her life got interrupted. Me, RIP and then Elora got strung up on the Cul'Sir pillars, restrained and silenced, but they healed me and Elora just enough so we was conscious again.

Salomon and Adrik did this weird kinda dance which involved them taking turns falling on the ground then getting back up, but eventually Adrik couldn't stand up any more, and they carried him over to the last pillar where Tishnar was restrained. Tishnar was released and then much to all our surprise revealed that she was actually Coteth disguised as Tishnar! So now we have no idea what's become of Tishnar, I reckon they probably already killed her, otherwise why bother with the farce?

The three witches did a bit of a crazy baddie rant, it was not the best mad baddie rant I've ever heard, but the special effects more than made up for it as the Cul'Sir altar pulled some kind of energy from all four of us… or maybe our artifacts… or maybe both… the result being Lharvion crashing back into the sky. The moon associated with Zorat, the plane of madness has returned, which can only mean the plane is no longer sealed away. I don't know for sure, but I'm guessing that's bad.

With their goal accomplished, the witches went on their way, leaving their minions to dispose of us. Lucky for us, we've got friends in Scry places, and Ly'cee d'Sivis stepped in with a fleet of Amanatus dwarves to save us.
