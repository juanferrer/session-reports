**Start Date**: 17th Dravago (late afternoon)

As we started the session with a number of problems for the party: The goblin crew of the fishing boat Picotee were demanding bloody retribution ontheir would be murders from The Queen Dannel; The Bernard Castle was taking on water and the enemy galleon was now an inferno and in danger of exploding.	A subtle charm person spell from Elora clamed the Bugbear captain, while Able was sailing the Castle away from the burning ships. Adrik and RIP began work on repairs while a deal was struck with the goblins to split any reward for their captive.

With the ship out of danger loot was split with the crew and a course was set for Trollanport. Able and Elora tried taking some of the crushed yellow crystal. Both of them immediately felt the effect of focused perception from the drug and Able got a reply from the sending stone; but it was in an unintelligible language and took some psychic damage. Elora was secretly also using her sending stone but did not get any answer. The next day the duo tried again - this time with Able casting comprehend languages - and received the message translated as "I do not understand outsider. Captives are taken. What we found in the sea is ours. The door they opened." Once more to her disappointment Elora did not get a reply. After discovering the cost of the dragon shard they had huffed they realised this was going to become an expensive habit.

With the assistance of the highly motivated crew RIP was finally able to attached his Bullseye lantern to his hat and added his ruby and cast continual flame to give himself a permeant light source.

Arriving in Trollanport a House Lyrandar officer came aboard and took custody of the captured (pirate) captain in exchange for a 2000g receipt. The party said goodbye to Cpt. Greenbottle and headed ashore - with Able taking measures to go unnoticed. The 2000g receipt was exchanged at the harbour office and split with the goblin crew. They also picked up a 'most wanted' list (to be supplied in a handout).

Most of the crew headed to the city barracks to inquire about Kelben Lingenhall - the guards there informed them they did not know of Kelben but suggested they try to see if his address was registered with House Sivis. The clerk at Sivis confirmed Kelben lived in the city but they could not give out his address (bloody GDPR!) however they could send him a courier delivered note - RIP and Elora followed the courier with increasingly poor stealth checks cumulating in RIP kissing Elora as a distraction.

Meanwhile Able went to The Triumvirate library to research dragon-shards, drugs and the strange language she's heard from the stone. She learned there are three types of dragon-shards corresponding to the three progenitor dragons. The rarest of which being Siberys dragon-shards which fall from the Ring of Siberys, mostly in Xenâ€™drik and form the power source for the most powerful eldritch machines and legendary artefacts. She also learned crushed Siberys crystals are known as the street drug Gold Dragon which heightens perception but sometimes causes hallucinations. Unfortunately she was not able to determine the origins of the language she's heard from the stone.

Reunited at their tavern the party swapped theories on what they had learned about the drug and the stones meant - was it just an hallucination? Elora explained she too had a sending stone that she had been using to try and contact someone from Cyre to find a missing family member.	She said she had not received a reply on her stone with or without the drug. While waiting for a reply from Kelben, Elora attempted to buy some more Gold Dragon but had to settle for a bottle of Ruby Boogie - she has no idea what its effects are.

With no reply from Kelben after two days the party visited him at his house. There they found getting coherent information out of the gnome challenging as he seemed to be suffering from some kind of dementia.	Between his rambling he did mention two former colleagues; Merxif Nackle and Myna Rofferton. Before leaving Able asked his carer (Jelbi) about his medicine (Filant-monoxal) and then pick pocketed it.

Outside a hooded gnome passed a note written in dwarfish to Adrik - informing him they were being followed by The Trust and to meet her at The Hare's Hair. Adrik silently alerted the party and they headed back to their tavern to plan. Able realised someone was attempting to scry on them - but after succeeding in blocking it knew they were safe for 24 hours. Elora spotted a man in the bar, apparently watching the stairs to their rooms so after waiting for dark the party headed out the window.

Attempting to sneak through the crowds along the harbour towards The Hare's Hair tavern, Able bumped into a fruit seller - scattering his wares over the quayside - Elora was able to nip in and get her out and the party made use of the distraction to make some progress to their destination. However Able noticed they were still being followed by a woman pushing a pram - she decided to take one for the team and was last seen being lead way by the woman.

Finally the rest of the party met the mysterious gnome in the Hare's Hair who turned out to be Folly Lingehall (Kelben's daughter) who offered a deal where she would tell the party where her father's notes and belongings had been taken if they helped get him out of the city and away from The Trust.
