**Start Date**: 9th Vult --- ASTRAL-DAYS 7 (Mid-morning)

We arrived at Olarune, an endless, empty desert. We need to find these "soft spots", which are portals surrounded by trees. We will need to experiment with it to find a way through because they're all different. We will need to mark the place somehow, because we will need to return to that place to come back to Olarune.

While looking for the soft spots, Abel started fiddling with her mask and managed to discover another feature, which helps her find manifest zones and portals. Will be great for finding our way back.

We did some ninja moves to go through the portal and appeared in a forest clearing and it was night. The forest felt magical. I tried to gather some wood, as I'm sure it has some interesting properties, but it was all wet and probably unsuitable for my purposes. There was also the smell of bread being baked coming from a ruined structure nearby. A large goat-like creature was the source of the smell. It was trying to eat Abel, so I gave it some bread. The thing ran away, knocking over some rocks that uncovered a tubular container, looked like a scroll-case. Inside it we found an ancient piece of paper, some characters looked very like the one slab keys for the planar gate.

Elora found a speaking plant. She started dancing with this plant. Its name was Oloren Windpetal. Sounds suspicious, but Elora enjoyed it. The plant knew about the Tikka thing. It mentioned it was a powerful creature that gave them trouble sometimes. Apparently it can fly, but it looks like a cat. Huge teeth. Oloren recognised trunky as made of Serpent Peartree, a very rare tree from Lamannia. They showed us the way to the Tikka. We passed other trees that appeared to be moving. Awakened trees! This place is very interesting.

Ollie ran into a hole inside a tree, that led to a huge cave. We went in and fell into a pool of oil(?). Ollie then appeared and threw a lit torch towards the pool. Come on, where did they get a lit torch from?!? And why try to kill us? Elora catched up to them while RIP and I climbed out of the pool. Elora tried to get them to stop, but the thing tried to charm Elora and when it didn't work, it tried to run away. Elora used lightning bolt, which almost burnt it to a crisp. We started chasing it and the plants in the cave started to grow to block our way. Water started flowing into the chamber and we all tried to break the vines. We managed to do it, but as the room was filled with water, we were flushed out. Then a boulder started rolling down the tunnel towards us. They really were prepared for us!

We kept running after Elora and Ollie. We arrived at a room with a bunch of mushrooms that made you bounce around. I almost made it all the way to Ollie and Elora, but fell and got confused after breathing the spores of the shrooms. When I came back to myself, Ollie was gone and there was only a wall emitting white light. We tried to walk through but to no avail. After trying a few things, Abel thought it looked similar to Prismatic Wall. She started walking us through the different layers and how to destroy them.

This opened up to a canyon with a river flowing at the bottom. A few dragon-like plant creatures came up as we were crossing a leaf bridge and started acting hostile. We had to put them down.

*Here Adrik's diary breaks off, and we see a series of images…*

*Our heroes entering a cavern where Oloren rides the fearsome Tikka…*

*The Tikka crunching down on Oloren, killing it with one bite of its hideous jaws…*

*Our heroes, badly bloodied and desperately fighting for their lives…*

Tune in next week to what may be our final episode!
