**Start Date**: 5th Olarune (Early morning)

While travelling to the Pirate Fest, Abel and I started working on a design to apply poison to my axe during the battle. It's too slow to do it when the battle starts!

RIP also turned the spare room we had into a kitchen.

We decided to leave the Duckess behind, so we all changed into our pirate outfits and got into the rowboat in a bottle Pan got in Flamekeep. We were received by an impersonator of Ozzie, the pirate we captured and got a reward for. He was executed last year. He asked us to identify ourselves and gave us the program.

We met Pan's old crew. Things got a bit rough, but no punches were thrown. We claimed our tent and went to the tavern for the Grogathon.

Abel and RIP participated, Elora and I held back. Abel and RIP both managed to get first and second place.
I participated in the Arms o'War and won both rounds. The second was against a HUGE orc. Dude almost gets me, but Elora and RIP both helped me. RIP was a bit drunk, so he just barely cast the right spell.
After the game, Fapplestamp, Pan's old first-mate, approached me and started talking about dwarves and how cool we are. He said he identifies as a dwarf. It was all a bit strange.
Lastly Elora participated in the Shanty-Off and won by a landslide. It was almost sad to watch the other participants.

At the end of the day I went to Fapplestamp's tent. He was for some reason infatuated with me. I told him I wanted to help him and gave him the cursed ring of protection. He thought I was proposing! That's ridiculous! Anyways, I told him not to tell anyone, as it might be considered cheating. I also told him not to use it until a moment of great need, as it only works once. I think he bought it. I would have felt bad about this, but he betrayed Pan! Betraying a friend is nearly the most despicable thing you can do. He had it coming.

Next morning we had breakfast. RIP made some tasty biscuits.

First game of the day was Dunlet, a game where we acted as pirates trying to reach the coast and Fapplestam's team acted as the navy trying to stop us.
They used grease and stuff to make our trek more difficult, but managed to get to the other side through the clever use of our spells and abilities.

After that it was our turn to be the navy team. I positioned myself at the back and used thorn whip to pull them back. Abel lit a pool of oil on fire and they got stuck there. We won that one too.

We got a short rest and went on to Dungeon Delve. Goal is to gather as much gold as possible.
As soon as we walked into the dungeon we were attacked by a bear rug! It was a man, of course, but we imagined it was a bear rug. Interesting game.
