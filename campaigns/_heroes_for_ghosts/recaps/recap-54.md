**Start Date**: 26th Barrakas (Midday)

With their proto-forged army in tow the party entered the Cul'sir workshop at Cadmium and made their way into a furnace room. Not wanting to linger in the heat they opened the next door and were confronted by a fire giant who seemed to be working on a colossus. The fire giant called out in alarm, grabbed his two shields and charged… The hard hitting attacks from the giant were a cause for concern and his tough armour made him nearly impervious to damage, but under the onslaught of attacks from the party and proto-forged he was cut down and ultimately killed by Abel disintegrating his heart. The final fire giant in the facility arrived too late and attempted to retreat for reinforcements. Adrik chased him down and tried to get Brlain in position for the final kill, but when the Drow failed, Abel's Synaptic Static finished him off.

The group investigated the 'under construction' colossus and noted the similarities with that being unearthed by Sashem in the Mournland. They pondered if the protoforged found here were so similar to those on Khorvaire were they invented here and had House Cannith been borrowing Giant technology for much longer than previously thought? Keen to put the war machine out of action Abel started unpacking the Sphere of Annihilation, while Elora tried speak with dead on the fallen giant. They learned the colossus was being constructed for Magtag (a fire giant chief) for a war with the day walking small races, and it needed Severance to activate. RIP who had been studying and attuning to the scythe looted from the giant tried to activate the colossus with it, but received no response…

Meanwhile a small trap door appeared in the floor nearby and an imp courier emerged, brandishing a note for the party. The imp tried to get someone to sign for it but Abel read the document and realised it was a soul contract. The imp dodged a kick from Elora muttering about how they couldn't blame a guy for trying… The note contained a one-pad key that the group used to decrypt the key to the Daanvi side of the cubic gate (Exquisite Regulation). Knowing RIP could not go through with the SoA, Able, Adrik and Elora decided to scout it out.

The three found themselves standing in a huge marbled square with dozens of terraces rising up on all sides. The terraces were full of devils and angels moving between scores of portals. A small robot trundled up to the party and ask for their travel papers. It did not accept the invitation note and proceeded to write them up a ticket for illegal portal use. Abel tried to lie about her name but was unable to do so! Refusing to answer questions about their net worth (for fine calculations) they stepped back through the Gate and returned to RIP.

Figuring without the scythe the giants would be unable to complete the project they decided to leave it and return to the tunnels. A lengthy discussion was had on how to proceed and they eventually settled on teleporting to Indigo and sending Lyesrin back to Stormreach via the gate. Their sudden teleportation to Indigo startled the Cannith alcohological engineers who were studying the machinery. After some arguing it was agreed they could spend the night there and for them to sell Abel some magical chalks and inks. Arrangements were made for Lacey Omaren to collect Lyesrin from the Xen'drik gate site and escort her to Stormreach. Not wanting the Cannith engineers to see the SoA the party headed down into the Khyber tunnels before burying it in the wall with stone shape.

The gate was opened to Daanvi and the group was again accosted by the prime gate automaton. The uni-wheeled robot announced their sanctions had been calculated and presented them with 12,000g fines. RIP had not previously been to Daanvi got written up for lack of travel papers. 

A stretched coach pulled up and a large devil approached the group, handing off a stack of paperwork to the automaton, and informing them "da boss wud like a wurd". Lounging inside the coach was Hasanas. The devil congratulated them on finding the first three of the Cul'Sir tools and informed them he knew where the final one was; he just needed a little favour… Hasanas had been trying his hand in the entertainment business, as a music producer, but he'd run into some trouble after getting drunk and betting the CEO of Phoney Music he had better acts. On sobering up he realised this was a terrible mistake as he's only had Lame Wafer and The Marooned Five under contract, both of which were awful. So he needed Elora to play in a battle of the bards at the Hellcienda nightclub and beat Dremoth's musicians. The battle was to be held that night at the club and some of the most powerful devils on Daanvi would be in attendance. If they were to steal Dremoth's prized instrument (the Cul'Strat) and destroy some of his contracts all the better.
