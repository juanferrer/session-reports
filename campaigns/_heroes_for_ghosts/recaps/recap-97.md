After peeking through the north door, we met Hector, who wanted non-gold desperately. I gave him a handkerchief and he dunked it into a box of foul-smelling yellow liquid. I think it was urine. I got rid of it as soon as he was out of sight.

We decided to move on northward to the library. We found a beholder reading in the library and Elora snuck in to see what she could find out. Reading over the Librarian's shoulder, she notes the book is called The Unseen Codex: Secrets of the Veil. She thinks she saw something strange inside, so we all went in acting like we belonged. The Librarian was a bit confused, but was keen to accept Abel's donation on One Slabs: Cryptography of the Giants. After that, she went to check out the thing Elora saw, which ended up being a portal. I distracted him asking about books on poison while Elora grabbed up the Codex and everyone left through the portal. I followed through the portal while he was fetching some bookmarks for me. I'll drop by on the way out. I don't want to let him down.

Beyond the portal we arrived at a much larger library, with more books than I've ever seen. It also had staircases leading nowhere. Vaster was inside and as soon as noticed us she let out a monologue about how us killing her meant nothing and that she was just fine here, and that she was going to kill us and got very specific about it.

Abel surprised us all by teleporting in and stood there taking fire from everyone around her. RIP cast silence and blinked out of existence. Badrik and I (pink haired all over) ran in and started hacking at her. Very effective.

RIP used antimagic field and tried to hug Vaster, and for the rest of the fight it was RIP and I chasing her, slowly whittling her down while Abel and Elora dealt with the flying books. In the end, Abel destroyed her with a level 9 magic missile.
