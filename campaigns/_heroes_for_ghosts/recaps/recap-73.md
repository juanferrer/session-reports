**Start Date**: 17th Zarantry  --- ASTRAL-DAYS 10 (Midday)

We've got presents! Our fans have sent us:
- A selection of pickled humanoid eyeballs
- Four Wintersday wooly jumpers
- A mindflayer mask
- A plushee beholder
- Four leather jackets emblazoned with Sharn Airsled

Oh yeah, and some terrifying fan fiction… we could only manage one of them, I think we need some therapy before we try any of the others.

We stopped in to visit General Nordar who is camped out on the Cyre border, its the place to be for any serious warmonger right now. We spoke to her about the colossus, which I think might have been a mistake. She basically wanted us to hand over the locations and go about our other business. Or at the very least, could we please destroy the colossus near Karnathi first? We made some non-committal noises and went on our way.

We got Lycee to put us in touch with Mercs d'Cannith, hoping he could give us a way to locate the other colossus. Actually thought we were getting somewhere with him when he promised to tell us how to locate and destroy the colossus in exchange for being able to study RIP for a period of 1 month, within the next 6 months time. Buuut his info turned out to be next to useless, he didn't have any way to confirm a location, though he did confirm that disintegrating the brain would destroy one. At least RIP doesn't have to be a guinea pig after all.

Then Control called us, and also tried to convince us to give her the colossus. At this point, I'm wondering who all ISNT going to call and ask if we'll just hand over the weapons of mass destruction pretty please for the good of all mankind?!

Anyway, Control at least did have something useful to say, which was to tell us that the Ice Castle we're heading for is called the Fey Spire, or Tyr Syrin, and comes from Thelannis. Apparently the Daughters contacter her about some prophecy "If the day comes when spire of The Book freezes forest four years without thaw the incarcerated lord will be freed. Only on The Anvil may the chains that bind be broken". Naturally the four years is up next month… as Adrik put it "Oof… we're always short on time". Control also informed us that the warmongers have crossed the border, so seems like that's more time we're short on.

We finally got to Making, Saeshem was there to greet us. We got his somewhat-blessing to destroy the colossus. Spent the day investigating the colossus (this one is Norr) and helping the rest of the reforged evacuate. Mero and Silirs chose to head out with the reforged to help them build their new home. I had a good chat with Mero before he left, hopefully convinced him not to go on some hare-brained crusade after Elora's father.

Between my tinkering and Elora's mindreading, we figured out that the colossus has a sort of connection to all the others, and a dog-like self awareness. So we did the obvious thing, and made a mechanical dog and transferred the brain into it. We have named it NorrDog. The second Elora told it to fetch, it was off, haring across the Mournland, and before long had led us to another colossus (Tymber), which I brain-melted with disintegrate.
