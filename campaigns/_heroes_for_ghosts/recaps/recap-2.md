**Start Date**: 7th Dravago (Morning)

After nearly a year apart, the Party found themselves looking for work at the Sword and Staffing agency. There they won the favour of the goblin receptionist (Tinx) when Able fixed the waiting room's broken music device. Following a short interview with Ms Ain (Human female) the Party was offered a position working house security for a Mr Toquill Voldak (human male) for a salary of 90 gold a month. 

After a trip across the city the Party arrived at Toquill's manor (11 Hastehampton Way, Platinate District, Middle Ward, Sharn) where they met the elderly and slightly eccentric owner. It transpired Toquill had made his fortune in his younger days exploring the continent of Xen'Drik but was spending his later years as an inventor and scientist. The party soon learned however (sounds of not too distant explosions) he was having problems with his lasts invention after the Mephits powering it had got lose and started to breed. Though a difficult fight Adrik managed to capture the steam mephit and the party was able to kill off the others before the micro-elementals were able to finished cooking the dwarf in his own armour!

After a rest Toquill showed the Party the main focus of his work and the reason why he needed such capable security. His vault contained a collection of some of the most fearsome weapons of The Last War. The collection included, a bound elemental cannon, a siege staff (aka Wand), a ballista with infused bolts, various magical grenades and something called a Clustered Planar Annihilation Device (aka CPAD). Toquill explained the extreme danger of the devices and how his research was focused on the possibility some of them might have been responsible for the Mourning. He also explained how his former guards had not heeded that warning as the sooty outline of a group of humanoids on the wall stood testament.

The Party began their guard duties with concern that someone might be planning on steeling some of the weapons. Able made use of the Alarm spell to protect some key entry points. The concern of a possible robbery gained ground when Adrik spotted a gentleman apparently scouting outside the house. Elora attempted to stealthfully follow the man, but apparently had forgotten some of her rougish skills after a year in her new profession as a bard. She did however manage to follow him into the nearby pub (The Full Plate) where she lost track of him. There she did meet a woman reporting to represent a group of concerned citizens, who made an offer for the party to not interfere while they removed the dangerous weapons from Toquill's vault.

Back at the house the Party discussed the offer but decided to side with Toquill and attempt to prevent the heist. They informed Toquill of the plot and attempted to locate the leak about the location of the secret weapons. Toquill explained only his former guards and a contact in Brelish Military Intelligence knew about them. The Party reasoned BMI would just take the weapons if they wanted them so the deceased guards must have been involved - but no further information could be found at that time.

A plan was hatched where the Party would make the required chalk mark to indicate they were going to allow the heist, but ambush the intruders in the vault (RIP took up position in the vault and the rest around the house). That night a couple of intruders broke into the kitchen and began noisily breaking things and scrawling something on the wall. Meanwhile another three individuals entered via the backdoor and began moving to the basement vault. They acknowledged but took no action against party members they saw; believing them to neutral.

We concluded the game with the Party trying to sneak into the basement behind the intrudersâ€¦

**End Date**: 10th Dravago (after midnight)
