**Start Date**: 21th Olarune (10 am)

We find Elora's mum having a dinner party with some Githyankis disguised as Cyreans. Elora sees through their disguise and alerts Abel, who delights in confusing them with their lack of local knowledge. Coteh is trying to get a moment alone, but Elora casts dominate person on her. Elora makes her tell the guests to leave, then makes her reveal her true self, before lightning bolting her. The creepy guest people come back in the back door. We ruin Coteh and her dinner guests, and message Elora's mum to give her the good news.

We study the things we found in faux-Control's office - a locket which makes divination magic target the wearer instead of the person it's aimed at, and an hourglass with a prophecy foretelling the arrival of the warforged colossus.

We spend the night, before heading for the Astral Sea. We sit down to a meal with Mero and Silarus. Silarus tells us that Githzerai and Githyanki were both inhabitants of Eberron, in a place called Githern, around 20,000 years ago. She talked about when the barrier fell - the ring of Syberus was broken when we arrived. Few Githzerai escaped when Eberron changed, mostly the ones already living in the Astral Sea. Lharvion/Xoriat used to be a place of mind. Some Githzerai were corrupted into Illithids. 720 Astral years ago the Outsiders were weakened. Three travelled to Eberron and were incapacitated. The remaining four in the Astral Sea were able to be imprisoned. We also learn that the Grove is a Githzerai station which orbits Rhaan.

After some discussion, we decide that we can call in some favours to deal with the Salamon/Xos situation back on Eberron, but we should take care of the issues at the Grove. Specifics of the plan:

BB has agreed to take us to Lharvion. We have Control's body in the bag of colding with us, so after we attune we can Planeshift to the Crag. We will contact our contacts to go to Pelmarane and prevent Xos from being freed. We can then Planeshift back to Rhaan (using Thelanis attunement) and hop a ferry to the Grove. Assuming we survive whatever's going on there, it will be on to Xoriat.
