You left the safety of the temple as the Candlekeepers were preparing the ritual for "the lighting of the torch", and caught a glimpse of the pale blue glow near the mountains. You traversed Falcon Forest and the hills around Crossings, eventually reaching Sixton.

During the trip, Tobias had a dream where a suave demon analysed your quest and proposed an alternative path. Tobias rejected the offer, only to wake and realise the rest of you had also witnessed the exchange.

Sixton was tense, with ongoing draft efforts and unease over a recent murder, rumoured to be part of a pattern. Despite claims from Chief Constable Preston and Father Collins dismissing supernatural fears, you suspected otherwise.

Following the relic's pull, you explored the sewers, but were stopped by a patrolling officer as you emerged from a manhole. He warned you to behave and sent you on your way. You returned to the cathedral and became ever more suspicious at the priest's nightly affairs. Later that night, once he went to bed, you broke into the cathedral and found a hidden door leading to the basement, where you found detailed records of Collins' secret rituals, and the monster he created. The chained abomination stirred as Collins pounded on the locked door above.

Seeking answers, you confronted the priest, but the creature broke free. Owl struck a weak spot, forcing it to retreat. When you returned downstairs, you found it had smashed through a wall and escaped into the sewers.
