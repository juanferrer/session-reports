Stopping in a damp coastal town, you exchanged some words with the occupants of the soggy tavern. That night, Owl sensed an unseen presence near their camp and Vrok discovered his gold had been stolen by a macaque.

Following the relic's pull, you reached the shore, but the relic pointed further. Back you went and convinced Sebastian to take you out to sea again. Between jagged rocks you foind a young woman's corpse, bled dry and salted like food. More bodies followed and you resolved to alert the townsfolk to retrieve them.

When the relic pointed directly downwards, Pacts disguides Owl as a fish and she dove down. Amid sea pillars, she found no relic but did spot a strange figure: a man herding fish. She surfaced and everyone followed her down. You eventually found the man, but he fled, leaving you alone to explore an opening in the rock, which ended up leading you to Azuria, an underwater village of merrow. There you were received by Thalorian, who explained their situation and agreed to consider giving up the relic in exchange for a solution to their problem.

When he expressed the expectation to keep Owl, you couldn't let it go and went to town on Thalorian and his guard. The one that conferred you the Gift of Water-Breathing revoked the gift before dying, leaving you in a bit of a pickle.
