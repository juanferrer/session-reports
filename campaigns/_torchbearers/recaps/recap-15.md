What appeared to be certain death turned out to be hardly a setback. Tobias made it back into the boat without issue, but the strange fish started gnawing at the hull. Meanwhile, Vrok outran the corrupted crocodiles, only to be surprised by three swamp natives bursting from the brush. The crocs got one of them and the others fled. You noticed on their skins the same red marks as the wildlife near the now-closed portal. Against Owls advice, Tobias fished, prepared and consumed one of them. And paid for it.

Back in Tiversbog, an unintended street show took place and lifted the townsfolk spirits, before quickly moving on to the city. Tobias and Vrok set up an unlicensed stall in Foundry to sell some of the stolen/recovered goods, but saw little success until Owl's marketing campaign. Just as things started picking up, the ground did the opposite.

First, tremors. Then a quake. Then, a reality gash splitting open in the market. Demons poured out of it, killing everyone in sight. Pacts and Tobias prepared to close the portal, but acknowledging the risk, everyone backed away and escaped the city. Refugees flooded the roads for the rest of the journey; every town preparing as if for war. 

In the capital, Rosamund was caught up in the council, but managed to give you some info you had requested. Vrok and Owl sought to get a job from Felix in an attempt to frame him for something and were given an assignment to kill Lucian, and a plan started cooking.
