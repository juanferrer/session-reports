After departing the dwarven settlement, you followed the relic's pull eastwards to Foundry. Along the way you heard rumours of a witch burning local villages. Upon investigation, you discovered it wasn't a witch, but the same gnomes you set free causing the destruction. Setting a trap, you ambushed the gnomes, with Owl brutally leading the murderin'. She killed Jerry and later executed Constantin during interrogation, marking their bundled corpses with a bloody warning: "This land is under the protection of Aeonis". Later you began spreading the legend of "The Paladin of Aeonis" in Foundry.

You witnessed the Ironway, a large metal carriage bound south and marveled at the industrial city's automaton demonstrations. Tobias found a fence and secured a comfortable night at a local inn.

The next day you headed south-west, to Tiversbog where you left your horses and rented a boat to navigate into the swamp's twisting rivers. After several days you reached a lamp-lit hut deep in the bog, where you prepared to sneak inside.
