Owl prepared a heart-warming surprise for the gnomes, drawing most of them back to their settlement. The rest of you rushed in and began executing the stragglers. You retrieved the stone ring from the bottom of the blood font and ran off into the night, not stopping for anything.

Once you finally made it out of the woods, a crawling demon attacked you. You gave it a hiding, but the fiend escaped towards the village, killing a few of the men before you finally put it down.

You helped the people bury their dead and treat their wounded and left the following morning.

Upon reaching Crossings you informed Rosamund of your progress and prepared to leave as soon as the relic activated again. Vrok had a bit of an eye-opening with his new employer and requested Tobias' help, which turned to an old friend for information.

Pacts stayed away from the library and Owl worked on and submitted a story.

The relic guided you to Gargola, to the house of a certain baron Sangescu. You had your suspicions and decided to plan a heist.
