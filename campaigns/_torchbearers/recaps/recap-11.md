After being warned to leave by the "Big Wizard", you continued your journey despite a short disagreement with your guide regarding going back. Through the blizzard you followed a column of smoke to a dwarven burial ceremony, where you they reluctantly welcomed. Vrok's victory over Yakham, the dwarf in charge, improved relations, earning you an invitation to their city.

There you learned that the dwarves had been under attack by an ice entity. During dinner, you shared details of your mission and showed the relic to Yakham, your host, who recognised the runes from elsewhere. He later took you to their temple where he pointed out the runes accompanied by a carving depicting a group of men, led by a woman, presenting a ring to a dwarven king. Pacts was able to translate the runes: "Seek not mere desire". An elder explained the story behind the ring, said to be safeguarded by the dwarved but now lost.

After gathering supplies and drawing some odd looks from the dwarves that helped you put together your weapons, to prepared to continue your journey.
