After waking the skeletal priests, they guided you to the entrance of the trial and prompted you to how to start the process. You solved each puzzle one by one, until at the end were received by a massive library which you explored at your heart's content. Pacts, however, was terrified and refused to enter. One of the priests did something to you, forcing you to re-live your trauma and ended up unconscious for three days.

During your stay, you uncovered the purpose of your mission, the temple and what would be required of you. You learned of the last group, headed by Lorena and other torchbearers before them. The priests slowly regained their humanity and entrusted you with three ancient artifacts to aid you in your quest.
