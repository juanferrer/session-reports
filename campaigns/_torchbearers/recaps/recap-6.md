You set off and followed the relic in a south-western direction, through the Falcon Forest and crossing the northbound tributary of Eagle Creek, making your last stop in Alyf Exeter, the last village before the Mistwood. The faithful residents provided food after a session heartfelt preaching by Tobias.

At morning break, you ventured into wilderness, had an encounter with Cat Bayun, who shared enthralling stories about mundane topics until Tobias fell asleep. Pacts lost his marbles during his encounter with what appeared to be a grieving mother. While escaping, you ran into small men that offered to take you to their camp.

Once there, a shaman was able to restore Pacts body, but was unable to do so with his mind. Tobias woke up hours later. Owl and Vrok learned that the men were preparing for their feast celebrating the end of the harvest and were invited to take part. During this time, they also met Arish, a young man from Alyf Exeter who has gotten lost while looking for berries.

They celebrated until late into the night and slept back at the settlement. Owl fell asleep during her watch and Tobias, upon waking, realised Arish, was not with them. You heard music and followed cautiously.
