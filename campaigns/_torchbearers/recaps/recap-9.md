Owl urgently warned her parents to leave Gargola shortly followed by an earthquake and a massive demon that likely destroyed the city. On the journey to Crossings, Owl caught up with her parents, met her baby brother and shared some life updates. Once in the city, she helped them settle in moved some strings to get them extra food and medicine.

You reported to Rosamund, who, feeling the Church wasn't providing enough, offered more resources for your mission. Tobias requested a top hat and a pet hawk named Tony. Owl also learned her story placed second in the competition and was encouraged to publish more.

Pacts visited Yartham in the library. After some back and forth, he arranged a meeting with Klaus Lager of the Diligent Sacrifice, a group aiming to prevent a demonic entity's arrival. Pacts was invited to contact them in case you wanted to know more and possibly work together. Meanwhile, Vrok was warned by Felix not to interfere further. Tobias gathered intel from Lucian, linking Maggie and the Old Fishery to Felix's operation.

You visited the brothel where Tobias confirmed Lucian's info and stocked up on marbles. The next morning, while preparing for the day, Tobias felt the relic reactivating, but decided to keep that to himself until after the hit. You found Felix's thugs doing the rounds on the market and followed them to their office, where you spotted an open window you could possibly sneak through that night.
