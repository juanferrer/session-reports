Lucian agreed to the plan, but Maggie was another matter. Tobias invited her over for dinner, hoping to gauge her loyalty to Felix. When she showed up, Maggie appeared to have been expecting a small gathering (perhaps even a date?), but she rolled with it. When the plan was laid out, she didn't immediately reject it, though she made it clear both Lucian and the city had changed since "back in the day". In the end, she would do what was best for her business. Owl tailed her home, just in case.

That night, you stole a corpse from the Kindling House, but someone was watching. Pacts called them out, waking the neighbours. The snoop fled, but Pacts caught him, sending him crashing from a rooftop. The Cloaks took him away, believing him a thief.

The next day, you prepared the scene. Tobias signaled Lucian, Owld and Pacts scouted Felix's place and Vrok secured a cart and oil. The body was stabbed and doused on location. Tobias preached against Crypt to stir the crowd. Lucian arrived, and Owlix, enraged, stabbed him for all to see. Lucian fled inside, Owlix followed and Vrok set the place ablaze. Pacts' illusion kept people back while the real flames spread.

By morning, rumours ran wild: Felix killed Lucian.
