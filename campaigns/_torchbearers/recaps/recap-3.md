Pacts and Tobias had an escapade in the office building a found the doctored logbooks showing missing entries every few weeks, along with suspicious buying sprees after that. Marten, the assistant, escaped from Owl and Vrok and was surprised to find the other two snooping around.

They confronted Visanich, but he had to leave for an important journey. And so, they decided to follow them through the desert and were eventually invited to their camp.

After a few days, they reached a pyramid north of the mountain range and saw the soldiers unceremoniously loot the place clean. After exchanging their farewells, the group continued south-west to their destination, only to be stopped near the mountains by members of a tribe. They learned of the artifact and urged to to find more pieces.

The next day you reached the place, which was underground. After a few attempts, you decided to just search for an untrance, which you found in the afternoon. Vrok dislodged the rock blocking the entrance and prepared to remove it.
