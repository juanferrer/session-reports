Shortly before nightfall, Owl and Tobias searched the houses and found a small stash with some money. Meanwhile, Pacts discovered that focusing on the stone ring he could feel a "pull" in three different directions.

Waiting by the well proved fruitless and that night you saw nothing but nightmares and visions, which have continued every night since. You decided to set off west-north-west following what felt like the strongest pull.

You witnessed a demonic incursion and faced off against two demonic worms, which proved mighty opponents than their size would betray, but you were able to dispatch them.

Entering into the desert of Desolation, you encountered Neverfall, one of the military forts still active in the northern border. You were accomodated for the night and met Vittoria and Harold, the owners of the inn. You had an audience with commander Visanich, which tried to hide the logbooks from you and even tried to bribe Tobias before you left.
