After a quick walk around the property, you prepared a plan to snatch the relic without being seen. Later that night you realised the Baron was in the middle of a party and decided to come early next morning. And you did. You coerced a servant during her break to give you the keys and leave, but she alerted everyone and a search began shortly after.

You went all the way up to the third floor, prepared a decoy and found a secret lift. Vrok and Owl stayed back to face the servants while Pacts and Tobias went down to fetch the item. Unfortunately, it was no simple servant that opened the door and soon the baron was feasting on Owl's blood. He ordered the staff to put Owl away for dinner and revealed his true form to Vrok for unarmed combat.

Owl used some tricks to free herself from the grasp of the servants, grabbed Vrok's weapon and escaped. Pacts and Tobias retrieved the next part of the relic, a glass orb this time, and went back up to help... but you were just a little too late. Vrok jumped out the window and the vampire turned to you. Pacts, possibly out of his mind, jumped out the broken window and cast swap on the vampire and exposed him to the full force of the sun.

Finally, you all met back at the White Rose, grabbed your horses and headed to the city gates, but they were blocked by throngs of refugees. The city guard, unable to contain them, were trampled, but you managed to leave unharmed. And then Owl spotted in the crowd her mum with a baby.
