You approached the hut cautiously. Owl, transformed into a beaver by Pacts, scouted ahead before the rest of you moved in by boat. Inside you navigated a labyrinth of rotten corridors. Through the three rooms, you found possessions of the previous inhabitants of the house, even the skeletal remains of one of them. There was also a button hidden in each room.

Throughout your exploration, the house seemed alive. Doors closed behind you and you glimpsed fleeting shadows out of the corner of your eye. The threat soon materialised when a too-many-legged creature attacked. Fortunately, it was not lethal, with Pacts' magic sending its limbs flying.

The house seemingly cleared, you pressed all three buttons and discovered a trapdoor that led to a submerged office. In there you found the piece of the relic, among other goodies. The peace, however, was short-lived, as the creature reformed and ambushed Pacts, nearly killing him before the rest of you intervened and drove it off. Before leaving, Owl set the hut ablaze. The fire consumed it as you made you way back.

Part of the information you discovered in the hut was the effect of the relic on portals. You experimented with it. After a few days of travel back up the river, you reached again the whirlpool you had encountered earlier, now much larger and teeming with strange creatures. You decided to test your hypothesis and devised a bold plan. Using Vrok as bait, Tobias would swim down to the hell rift below, disrupting the portal. The plan worked, though Tobias found himself in an uncomfortable position.
