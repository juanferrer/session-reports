You left the dwarven keep armed and determined to confront the ice demon causing the storm and found it in a clearing, moving rapidly and seemingly searching for something. Using the newly named GOAT YL 1337, Tobias landed a direct hit, but the demon retaliated, tearing a gash in the air that unleashed a swarm of meat-spiders. A chaotic battle ensued.

Owl's demon-blood arrows melted the demon's flesh, while Pact's Witch Fire missed its mark. Vrok engaged the demon but was gravely injured. The Big Wizard arrived, warning everyone to retreat, but joined the fight instead using his magical abilities. The demon incapacitated Vrok while the cart, set ablaze by Pacts, exploded, engulfing the demon in flames. In its final moments, the demon killed Tobias and Rufus before succumbing to the fire. The troll fell to the spiders, which the group eventually finished off.

After the battle, Pacts retrieved the relic from the Big Wizard's corpse. Tobias was miraculously revived and recounted his divine experience. You buried Rufus, freed the enslaved gnomes and returned to Yakham to share the good news. Then went on to share the bad ones with the guide's widow.
