The session began when you entered the tomb. In the first room, you found water, mirrors and a locked door. Tobias realised looking through the water into the mirror revealed a keyhole, and Owl found a key in the same way. In the Grand Gallery you found scarabs all around the room and the genealogy of a certain King Reseph, inhabitant of the tomb. Continuing down, you found another locked door and a ritual room with instructions hinting at a dark deed. You decided to come back, returned to the beginning and tried another way.

The other hall led to yet another locked door, this one with an unsettling inscription and the symbol of an eye on the door. Tobias saw horrible things when looking into the eye, but unlocked the door. While inspecting the room and deciding wether the body was fresh enough for the ritual, you heard screams coming from somewhere inside the inverted pyramid. It turned out to be the soldiers, who lost a companion to the scarabs. You kindly offered to take the body and possibly restore it to life. And nearly! Sami, as you called it, opened the final locked door on reanimation. Inside you saw the relic and several sarcophagi. Pacts told Sami to fetch, the king rose from the dead and a fight ensued which left Pacts on the edge of death.

The rest of you retreated with the relic, regrouped and came back for Pacts. You barely escaped with your life.
