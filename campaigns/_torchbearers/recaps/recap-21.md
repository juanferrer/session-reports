With the sewer beasts defeated, you returned to the surface and brought the corpses to the constabulary, where they praised you for your efforts. While you rested at the cathedral, rumours spread fast: The Paladins of Aenois walk among us. By morning, the cathedral was surrounded by a hopeful crowd bearing gifts and offerings. Tobias delayed the service until nightfall.

The evening sermos was... theatrical, with special effects, relic joining and miracle healings. The crowd was moved by the speech, mostly to the front of the building, to Tobias and Urim. The officers had to intervene and the congregation was sent home.

The next day you left for Crossings. Rosamund was not amused. She updated you on the council's decisions and questions your choices, particularly Tobias'. When he downplayed Lorena's legacy, she nearly snapped. But when Tobias revealed Aeonis, she was left speechless.

Later Owl presented some designs to Alistair and one of them was implemented. A shortened-barrel rifle loaded with metal shards. With preparations complete, you headed south-east, bypassing Fortune and reaching Burbough island.
