Gasping for air and seeing someone flee with the relic, you quickly went back to the boat to follow. The creature was too fast, but with you emerged several of the young men that had been abducted from surrounding villages. You returned them to shore along with the corpses you could find. The townsfolk was incredibly grateful and some even volunteered to help you deal with the evil that had taken hold of the world. More people did the same after Tobias' moving sermon in Gateway.

Before reaching Fortune you encountered Agman with his demonic horde blocking your way. Unable to continue, you decided to find a different path. You decided to find safety for camp in the forest of Malhora. But something else found you. The lords of the forest, elves. You avoided a fight by the skin of your teeth and after a brief exchange, they allowed you to finish your rest.
