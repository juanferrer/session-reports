While Pacts was unconscious, he saw a woman singing in his dreams. It was a terrible and slightly prophetic song that Owl later found in a book in the library.

In the morning, the group continued travelling east away from the inverted pyramid. You spotted a sandstorm approaching from the north. The soldiers quickly decided to seek shelter in the mountains and everyone followed.

A demon appeared from the sandstorm and you fought it in the cave. At one point Marten turned into a strange creature made of sticks, leaves and mud, but only Pacts and Owl saw it.

You defeated the creature and carried on to Neverfall where you restocked your supplies and left for Crossings. Once there you met with Rosamund, who informed you about more demonic appearances in other places. Pacts and Owl wrote the report, Tobias received a letter from Ignatius and Vrok started moonlighting for a sketchy goblin.

Oh, and Pacts met Yartham, his newly-appointed hot assistant.
