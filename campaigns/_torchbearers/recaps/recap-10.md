Vrok seemed unusually quiet, so you decided to postpone the raid on Felix's property until he was feeling more like himself. You followed the relic north-east, towards the Iron Peaks. On the way you passed large numbers of refugees travelling south and learned that Volksbeck had suffered a fate like that of Gargola.

You played around for a couple hours with demon blood, basically tortured a few mice and continued on your way. Further north you traded boxes of cigars and a trippy plug for weather-appropriate clothing. You were given directions to reach the dwarven settlement further ahead and reached the place without delay.

The dwarven village was plain to the extreme, and you found your way to the only entertainment around: the drinking place. The barkeep, at first wary, loosened up once he saw you drinking like grown-ups. You found a guide that would take you east with the promise of "as much treasure as [he could] carry".

An unnatural storm had formed further east and you eventually ventured right into it. For several days you endured extreme temperatures and were nearing the point of collapse when an odd-looking creature stumbled upon your camp.
