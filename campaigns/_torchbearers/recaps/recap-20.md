Following the chaos beneath the cathedral, the city mobilised. Father Collins was arrested and the Chief offered sincere apologies for underestimating you. You had a full day's sleep and awoke to a city in motion: investigation, planning and coordination in full swing.

You interviewed a certain Urim that had turned himself in, claiming to be the killer and the monster. The police identified possible sewer nests and briefed you on the important points. You were assigned a squad and sent on your way.

Rather than search blindly, you decided to lure the creatures out. Pacts clamor succeeded and the beast emerged to a brutal ambush. Tobias humilliated one of them and Vrok finished the job. After killing one of the other creatures, Tobias transformed into a radiant image of Aeonis. The final creature collapsed, and from its head, Tobias pulled Agnes free.
