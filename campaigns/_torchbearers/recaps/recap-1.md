After jumping out the window of the burning house and delivering the leader of a dangerous cult, you had a few weeks of your regular work, only to be summoned again, as is customary.
This time your job would be to investigate the events that transcurred in Asylum and find out as much as you could from the malefic entity that allegedly emerged from the well.
You had a brief exchange with Patrisha, one of the survivors but she wasn't very useful with the information she shared. Tobias received some insight into Ignatius' secret sauce and Pacts requested a new assistant. This time the ability to read should be a requirement.
You travelled on horseback to Asylum and found it to be mostly deserted, save for a few ghouls feasting on the remains of the villagers. The encounter with one of them almost proved deadly, but you managed to dispatch it.

Searching around the collapsed well, you found a large stone ring that was inscribed with runes all around it. The item was clearly magical in nature, but its properties have not been discovered yet.

You decided to wait until nightfall, hoping that the creature would show.
