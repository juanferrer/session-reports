**Start Date**: 20th August YL 1337, around noon

The party started in a burning building extracting an unconscious Fredrich Nel, the leader of the Crimson Court. The fire had pushed them back into one of the first floor rooms and they were forced to exit through one of the windows. Vrok and Owl valiantly jumped down while Pacts fashioned a rope out of the curtains. Both him and Tobias used them to reach the ground. In the street, the people that had gathered rushed to their aid. They were hailed as heroes.

They escorted Nel to the Shrine's prison and was handed over to the guards, who thoroughly recorded the procedure. The group met with Zaal Barelis and were commended for a work well done. He also mentioned someone had already requested the same team to be assigned to an interesting case, and that they would receive the summons soon enough.

In the weeks that followed, they continued with their usual work, received news of Frederich's sentencing and, as expected, received a new summons.

During the meeting, they were made privy to the harrowing reports coming from Asylum. They were asked to investigate those events and whether there was any connection to the warnings by the child-prophets regarding the end of the world. Tobias requested horses for the travel to Asylum, and each of them received a horse for the assignment. Pacts requested a new assistant to replace his current, illiterate apprentice and was told his request would be considered. Owl asked to speak with a survivor, and a meeting was arranged.

Patrisha had outlived her husband and four children when escaping the massacre, which left her emotionally broken. Her physical injuries were being treated by medical professionals from the Church due to the sensitivity of the information she held.

The journey through the plains was quick and uneventful and they reached Asylum a few days later. Heavy rain, dark clouds and empty houses welcomed the party, as well as many a cart laden with old corpses. Upon inspection, some of them appeared to be "dried husks", while other looked like regular corpses in some state of decomposition.

While looking around the village, they found a ghoul in one of the houses feasting on the flesh of a deceased villager. Such abomination was not to stand, so Vrok charged the creature helped by Tobias' Impose Predictability. Owl and Tobias also hurt their target, which caused it to flee, only for it to be Swapped back into battle by Pacts. They quickly finished the creature, but not before it seriously wounded Owl. This mishap resulted in the rest of the day and much of the next being used to treat her and restore their strength. They decided that, even though this was an atrocity, they would not engage with ghouls at this time, as the risk to life was too great. And they had a more important task.

Considering the information they had, they decided to find the well and inspect the area. Only ruin remained, as it appeared to have burst open and collapsed outward. Among the rubble they found what appeared to be a segment of a hollow sphere, with runes carved all around its outer surface. Pacts recognised the script but was unable to decipher their meaning at this time. When holding it, they could sense the item seemed to pull magic out of the air, as if focusing it. More study will be needed to understand its properties and origin.

Based on Patrisha's account of the creature appearing at night, they decided to wait by the well until nightfall.
