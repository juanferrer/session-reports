**Start Date**: 23rd November YL 1337, late evening

In the cover of night, the group scouted the place for possible avenues and found the servant's entrance. They also noticed movement inside the house, as if something was being prepared. They went back to their accommodation and waited for a few hours, hoping to strike in the dead of night. However, when they got there they saw guests arriving and music playing inside the house. The rest of the street was quiet and empty save for a frail old man, attentively watching the house. Owl approached the man and had a brief conversation regarding the town, the baron and his lavish (and lascivious) parties. He also confirmed their suspicions, Stefan Sangescu was indeed a vampire.

The plan was reformulated and they prepared to return in the early morning. And so they did, going straight to the servant's entrance. They were stopped by one of the staff, but forced her to hand over her keys and leave. They rushed in and, while searching for clothes, found a sleeping servant in their quarters. Tobias and Owl dressed in the servant's clothes, Pacts used Disguise on Vrok and himself to look like other servants, and then again on the sleeping man to look like Vrok.

They searched around on that floor and found the storage area, with lots of food, ale and several bottles of highly aged wine. Tobias pocketed a few of those, but were later lost in the ruckus. As they continued to explore the top floor, they ran into a strange room that seemed to serve no purpose. Empty walls, no storage, only 3 walls on the side of the room, that would comfortably accomodate a secret chamber.

Vrok used his *master key* and, through the new hole in the wall, they saw what appeared to be a large iron wardrobe. A deep hum could be heard coming from the thing. Tobias opened its single door to reveal another metallic sliding door. As they were considering further exploration, a servant search party reached the top floor and found the sleeping Vrok-shaped man. They called their master and began searching the rest of the floor.

Just as they were about to reach the door, Pacts and Tobias entered the mysterious wardrobe and pressed a button on the one of the sides. Owl broke one of the windows, dropped to her knees and asked Vrok to do the same. Baron Sangescu found them and began questioning them. He saw right through the lie, but indulged in Owl's offer of her bare neck.

After pulling away he seemed confused, yet very interested in a second helping. He asked for her to be taken to his rooms, as he would stay behind to deal with an unarmed Vrok. Owl struggled and broke free, grabbing Vrok's weapon on the way out. He was not so lucky, however. The baron assumed his true form and Vrok couldn't do much to defend himself.

Pacts and Tobias reached the first floor, followed the relic to where it was pointing and bypassed the door with a clever use of Pacts' Hole of Glory. He fetched a purple-ish glass orb and a set of three gold coins and they rushed back up to help the other part of the group.

In the meantime, with the sun rising, Vrok attempted to push the vampire out the window. Seeing the creature was too strong, he ran to the broken window and jumped down. A small crowd started forming on the street but he wasted no time and ran to where he would expect Owl to be. Tobias tried, unsuccessfully, to shoot the creature with his rifle. Pacts tried something crazy. He also ran to the broken window and jumped out. But instead he turned around and cast swap on the vampire.

Pacts and Tobias observed it fall to the ground and explode into a fine mist. Deciding not to wait around, they took the lift back down and exited through a ground-level window, perhaps to the dissapointment of the onlookers. They all met back in the White Rose where Owl was preparing their horses.

The city gates, however, were blocked by a large group of refugees trying to get into the city. They were escaping the war in the South. The city guard was barely able containing them and, despite the party's efforts, a stampede ensued. In the confusion, the group escaped. Among the refugees, Owl spotted her mother nursing a baby.
