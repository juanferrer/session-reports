**Start Date**: 29th March YL 1338, night

The sun never came out. The silence was deafening, as if the entire forest was holding their breath. Eventually, they decided to lift the camp and move south, towards the city. As they were preparing to go, they began hearing screaming and laughter coming from the south, along with black smoke rising. The elves showed up, this time with their queen. She spoke with Owl and confirmed they would help them deal with the demons.

The camp and elves organised in small groups, with their division at the head, and headed in the direction of the fire. They say Agman, along with four creatures, setting trees on fire and causing as much destruction as they could. They set up an ambush and very quickly killed Agman, who had summoned two monsters from the abyss. The fight was hard and many died, but they were able to save most and put out the fires.

Owl asked Tobias to bless the site in honour of the fallen and made that a cairn be erected to mark the sacred place, all with permission of the elven queen. This one, in turn, blessed them and provided a small detachment to aid them in their quest. As the smoke cleared, they saw the storm in the back was becoming more aggressive. Red lightning would strike every few minutes

As they marched towards the city, they came across the Iron Way with one of the vehicles that seemed to have been attacked on the way. There were corpses and blood all around, but no sign of living activity. After much discussion, they planned to turn the vehicle into a bomb and send it towards the city. Pacts and Tobias scouted ahead (one serving as transport, the other as eyes) and saw the city and a massive hole at the centre. They saw the destruction and death brought about by the fiends, but also spotted, through the darkness, many small fires beyond Fortune

They approached cautiously, believing it to be a demon camp. Instead they were surprised to see humans, even some familiar faces. Tobias descended, with the aid of Pacts, in Stigmata, causing a commotion throughout the encampment. Marten recognised them and, when asked to speak with their leader, brought them to the Council. Rosamund, with many others fell to her knees in awe. They informed the council of the signal of fire to rush into the city, as they would attack from the other side.

They later went back to their own group and shared the news with everyone. The morale was short-lived, as they saw the beginning of a disgusting ritual and its first sacrifice.

**End Date**: 30th March YL 1338, midday (still dark, though)
