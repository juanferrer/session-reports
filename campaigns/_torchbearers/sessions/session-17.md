**Start Date**: 3rd February YL 1138, morning

Tobias visited his brother in the Cloaks headquarters and barely recognised him. He was barely a frame now and his face appeared ravaged by the years of drug abuse. Through conversation, Tobias learned that the specific drug was crypt and he had been using the supply that was given to him for dealing. And of course, the supplier was none other than Felix. After a lengthy conversation, it became clear that Gabriel's fear of the stitches was greater than prison, and could not be convinced otherwise. Perhaps this way he would get clean?

A certain Sophie Elliston published a first hand account of the horrors witnessed during the demonic incursion of Foundry. The story was incredibly successful, and the paper was eager for more pieces from Owl.

Pacts ask the group to join him in visiting the Dilligent Sacrifice. They found an unassuming building that had been converted into a soup kitchen. The chariy accepted a generous donation from them and took them to another room to speak with Klaus Lager. Both parties shared each other's goals and methods in vague terms and agreed that support would be beneficial. They would turn their demonic influences away from major cities, but double their focus in Crossings in particular.

Owl spoke with Alistair about designing an obsidian sickle and he exitedly began arranging everything. Other than that,

A few days later, the group started feeling the pull of the relic and decided to follow it back north west, into the Desolation. They decided to stop by Neverfall on the way and say hi to commander Visanich and his company, but they were received a gloomy and decimated force already preparing to leave south. They spoke with Marten, which informed them of the commander's violent death and of the creatures that had been attacking them every night. After gathering some more intel, Owl suggested they go to Crossings.

As they continued approaching the Man Asoura, they could hear tremors coming that way every hour or so. It seemed to be volcanic activity. They decided to avoid getting to close, and also stay as far south as they could from the unsettling cackling they could hear at night. However, it wasn't far enough. They were caught by surprise one of the nights when Owl fell asleep during her watch, which had a knock-off effect on the following watches. Tobias was able to hold them off for a few moments with his protective field, enough to the rest of the group to finish off the corporeal shadows.

Not wanting to risk any more attacks, they pressed on until they arrived at a stone structure, seemingly carved out of the Man Falout mountain range.

Inside, they discovered a mostly abandoned building with sign of earlier habitation, but long unused. One of the rooms was a dormitory, with several bunk beds with dressed skeletons in a few of them. While trying to discover the cause of death, one of them moved.
