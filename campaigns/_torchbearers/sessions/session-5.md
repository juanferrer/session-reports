**Start Date**: 2nd October YL 1337, early night

Pacts had a very disturbing dream with a woman stripping her own flesh. She was singing a song while doing it.

>Eleven living tithes for the Lord of Void<br>that we may be spared in his glorious coming.
>
>Ten iron veins ripped from the belly of the earth,<br>melted into tears towards banished brothers.
>
>Nine accursed relics to prevent His return<br>and a punishment to those whose hands were slow.
>
>Eight notes of warning scarring the firmament<br>compelling children to prophecy and sign.
>
>Seven nails piercing the flesh of the sinner,<br>restlessly hung on the dark wood of his crimes.
>
>Six voracious beasts born from six botched off'rings,<br>have their backs hardened by their race with the sun.
>
>Five houses to fall before this song's end,<br>and then five more reborn from their blackened remains.
>
>Four heedless watchers bent on the hunting trail,<br>may they choke on blood and corruption at last.
>
>Three books scribbled by pen of the deranged,<br>who refused to answer the call of the abyss.
>
>Two timelong rivals into a dark forest,<br>with a path leading out too narrow for both.
>
>One prayer for the summoned called by this song,<br>His Lordship will come as a thief in the night.

The dream stuck with him for a while.

Shortly after Pacts woke up, the group joined the two parts of the relic, which caused a pillar of light to illuminate the sky for a few minutes.
The group decided to ride back to Neverfall with the soldiers. As they were approaching the mountains, a strong wind started picking up from the north. In the distance, they saw a sandstorm coming their way. They rushed towards the mountain and spotted a cave to wait out the storm. A familiar sensation began while the storm was raging. Taste of metal and ringing in their ears. Another demon!

First they could hear muffled whimperings, which turned into flat out screams when the creature saw them.

Vrok ran to it in an effort to protect the rest of the group, but was gored by the demon and pushed back. A difficult fight ensued, with many almost losing their life. Tobias used forbidden magic to force the demon to... move his bowels... to an extreme effect. At one point, Marten climbed to a protruding rock and took a shot from the shadows. The demon followed him and they struggled. Owl threw a torch that way and she saw the demon and another creature made of rocks, sticks and mud. Pacts swapped positions with the demon and knew this was Marten, but in a different form.

After being subjected to the will of the Whimpering Man, Vrok finished off the demon, taking his unholy weapon as a trophy.

Both Marten and the soldiers were shaken by the encounter and they rode in silence for the remainder of the journey. Tobias had been checking on the relic frequently after the joining but it seemed unresponsive. No indication of where to go next.

They were well received in Neverfall and after a short stay, they decided to return to Crossings, report back and hopefully find some information about the relic and where to go next.

Once they arrived, they met with Rosamund Strassler and retold their experiences, omitting a few details. She told them about two similar encounters near Foundry and Tyros. Two teams had already gathered information and were preparing their reports. She promised to make them available once she had them.

Pacts met his new assistant, Yartham, a young and handsome man who worked out most of the librarian's system by the way the books were currently organised. He seemed very keen to learn from Pacts and was honoured to work for him.

Owl did some research trying to find information on the relic and didn't find much specifically mentioning it. What she did find was the opinion of different authors pointing out inconsistencies in the texts and how the Witness might be incomplete.

Vrok met Felix, a flaunty and wealthy-looking goblin who hired him to "help the boys" from time to time. Probably to scare peasants or something.

After a few weeks, Tobias checked the relic as he did every morning. This time, the relic was pulling to three new locations.

**End Date**: 18th October YL 1337, early morning
