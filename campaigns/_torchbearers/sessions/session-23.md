Wanting for air and seeing someone escape with the relic, they quickly regrouped and passed around the mouthpiece of Nodens as they ascended. Along with them, several other young men left the merrow village as the other inhabitants cowered in their homes. These men, it turned out, had been abducted from nearby villages and forced to engage in abhorrent reproductive practices.

On the way back they picked as many of the young women's corpses as they saw and made it back to the village. Having saved their children and dealt with the marine horrors, the locals received them like heroes. A few of the locals, some that had lost their children, followed them. Owl also spoke her first commandment. "Thou shalt not partake of the spotted fish. And they marveled at her wisdom."

The group decided to stop in Gateway hoping to have more unite their cause. Tobias gave a sermon by the docks, speaking of fear and freedom. Aeonis' presence seemed to be with this company and many decided to follow them to aid them in their quest. They followed after the relic with their small host, finding a path of destruction. Razed villages, maimed survivors and innumerable dead. Seeing their light, many joined their ranks.

As the faithful approached Fortune, they saw an army of demons blocking their path. Agman was at the head. They met with him in to parlay. He wasn't interested in negotiating anymore, as he claimed the relic was now beyond their reach. However, he seemed determined to enact an epic battle, as the many he had seen throughout the years. The group didn't not humour him, and instead turned back and looked for a better way through.

They stopped by the forest of Malhora and, as they were preparing to camp, they spotted a demon scout that had been following them. Pacts used his Portals to make it fall from a great height. They decided to venture into the forest and camp there. Well into the night someone gave an alarm at the camp. Something had been spotted. With everyone at the ready, Pacts flew up above the treetops and quietly descended, hoping to see what was there.

One of the creatures jumped on Pacts as another stepped into the light. Quick on her feet, Owl spoke to them in the Elven tongue. They recognised her as one of her own and invited her to join them and leave the savages to their fates. She explained their purpose and the elves backed off.
