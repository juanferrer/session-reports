The approach was slow and methodical. First, Pact turned Owl into a beaver and sent her in to check the hut. After a thorough look around, everyone approached on the boat. Owl unlocked the door and everyone walked into the dark corridor. The rooten floors creaked at every step. They followed narrow ways through a labyrinthine house. They found three rooms.

In the first one, they found the corpse and diary of one of the house' inhabitants, along with several books about life and death. Tobias decided to keep the books, in case they contained any interesting information regarding his condition. Under the bed they found a button that clicked when pressed. In the second room there was a suspicious carpet, which was hiding another button. Lastly, in the kitchen, they found a mess: broken furniture, scattered books, etc. Behind the bookshelf they found a third button.

For the entire time they had been hearing door closing somewhere inside the house and when backtracking they would find closed doors behind them. They saw a shadow out of the corner of their eye, which eventually turned out to be a large too-many-legged creature that attacked them. It was swiftly dispatched by the group, with Pacts causing its limbs to shoot out.

With the house clear, they pressed the three buttons at once and a trapdoor appeared in the centre of the house. Under it was a ladder going all the way into the water and into a small office full of books, trinkets and potions. In there they found a piece of the relic, along with a paper by the owners of the hut. While checking this out, the too-many-legged monster joined back together and attacked Pacts, nearly killing him.

The rest of the group arrived just in time to save him as he was being taken away by the monster. After leaving, Owl put her torch to the wood, causing it to quickly catch fire. Before too long, the whole hut was consumed by flames.

They began making their way back and quickly reached the same whirlpool they had found on the way there to have grown considerably, now with larger animals. Having learned of the relics ability to disrupt portals, they decided to send Vrok as bait while Tobias swam down to close the hell rift. And it worked! Vrok made it safely to shore with lots of strange crocodiles and fish in tail, but Tobias ended up in the water surrounded by similar fish, now focused on him.
