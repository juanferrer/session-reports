**Start Date**: 6th November YL 1337, foredawn

Awaiting the right moment to intervene, the group observed on. They witnessed, in horror, how the small men, arranged in a circle, went one after the other and dipped their white caps into a stone font holding most of Arish's blood. They saw the tiny tendrils at the bottom of each headpiece reaching for the red fluid.

Tobias realised the fragment they were after was at the bottom of the font, so they would need to get the gnomes away from it. Owl decided to run back to camp to set up a distraction while the rest laid in wait, but not for long. Wasting no time, she set fire to a few of the houses and ran back.

Mayhem ensued. A few of the small men tried to put out the fire, while the rest began awaking everyone. One of them ran towards the leader who was performing the ritual. He sent most of the participants back to camp to help, which left the font nearly unguarded. Vrok took advantage of the opening and charged towards one of the gnomes, nearly killing it in one blow.

The fight was quick and impactful. Pacts created a closed loop with Hole of Glory, causing the leader to reach terminal velocity on his *static* fall. While attempting to break out of the infinite drop, he got caught at the edge of the hole, being split in half. Tobias put into practice the experimentation with the pigs heads and caused the eyes of one of the gnomes to explode. Owl rummaged through the gore and retrieved the relic from the bottom of the font. They didn't wait for the fallout and ran until they were at a safe distance. Ignoring everything else in the woods, they reached the edge of the forest by dawn.

Then the rain began. At first welcome, it soon became clear this was no natural rain. One of the clouds appeared to be descending and was accompanied by a clicking noise and the now familiar taste of metal. The cloud turned out to be a huge tubular demon with too many legs.

It regarded them for a moment before rushing towards them, meeting Vrok halfway. This time, the fight was not so easy. The creature took and dealt many a blow, but near the end, seeing how dire its situation was, it attempted to escape... towards the village!

The group chased it, but the fiend was much quicker and upon reaching the settlement, began wreaking havoc. 8 people died before Pacts was able to cause it to explode with Division. Tobias and Vrok helped the townsfolk with their dead while Owl cared for the wounded. A barn was offered for them to rest in, and while in there, they joined the new part of the relic. Once again, a bright flash of light was followed by a pillar of light shooting up to the sky.

They departed the morning after and quickly made their way back to Crossings. They informed Rosamund of their progress and continued with their routines while waiting for another tug from the relic.

Tobias was warned about a possible hearing caused by a complaint from father Matthias about forsaking his responsibilities.

Owl wrote Cat Bayun's story from his perspective and even signed with his name. Minor embellishments were added for dramatic purposes. She left with the manuscript one morning and no one saw it again.

Pacts did not go back to his routines. In fact, he did not return to his home nor the library. Instead he found lodgings at the Bar and the Library. No books in sight, though.

Vrok was, as usual, picked up by Terry and Mike to go and threaten someone. This time, however, they were there not to warn, but to collect or wreck. Vrok hesitated when Karl, the friendly blacksmith, begged for another week to pay. He confronted his colleagues and *gently* convinced them to give poor Karl another week.

Vrok asked Tobias for help, who reached out to an old friend for information. After sharing what he knew, he agreed to help whenever they attempted something on Felix.

A few days later, the relic was back on. The followed the closer ping south towards Gargola. To their surprise, it seemed to be coming from within the city. Furthermore, it was clearly coming from within baron Sangescu's property.

They stayed a bit longer for the meet and greet and heard Stefan Sangescu speak about relatively uninteresting political matters of the city. They decided to would rob the place.

**End Date**: 23rd November YL 1337, late evening
