**Start Date**: 11th December YL 1337, foredawn

After a brief exchange with the "Big Wizard", the group was told to be gone by morning and the troll carried on its way. Upon waking and while preparing for the day, Tobias noticed the relic was now pointing north-west, back the way they came. Regretting his decision, Rufus suggested they turn back and return to the village, which the group refused. Begrudgingly, he continued as their guide.

A few hours into the day, they spotted through the blizzard a column of dark smoke. The numbness of their limbs took precedence and they decided to head that way. The promise of a warm fire felt too good to pass. They happened upon a dwarven burial ceremony at the bottom of a valley. They seemed on edge, but allowed them to rest by the fire. The dwarves were digging a mass grave for a few dozen bodies, which were lying on a cart pulled by mountain rams.

Vrok challenged Yakham, the leader of the dwarves, to a fight. Unarmed. Excited, the dwarves arranged in a circle and began trash-talking at Vrok, which caused an equivalent reaction. The dwarf was quick, but Vrok, fatigued as he was, connected with his jaw. To Yakham's surprise, he only managed to properly hit Vrok a single time. When Vrok got him again, he called it and Vrok was declared the winner. This massively improved the dwarves' opinions on Vrok and the group and led to them eventually being invited to rest in their keep.

On the way, Yakham shared with the group that they had been attacked twice now by an entity made of ice and were worried about it returning a third time. They offered to help.

Large stone doors welcomed them into the city, which had been carved into the mountain and extended well beyond their sight. They followed the funerary procession through the city and reached the temple, all while receiving odd looks from the citizens. Yakham guided them to his house and offered to host them during the stay. Even Rufus, "the slave" could stay.

During dinner the group went into more detail about their mission and showed him the relic. Yakham recognised the runes from a specific stone carving from their temple. The carving, which they later saw, depicted a woman followed by a group of people giving a thin ring to the king of the dwarves. Above the carving, they could see runes similar to the ones on the relic, but these ones Pacts was able to read: "Seek not mere desire".

The next day they spoke with one of the elders, who explained in detail the story behind the carving. The ring was given to them for safe-keeping and it would be claimed by others. According to the story, they would recognise them by their light. Sadly, the relic was lost and they don't know where it is.

The group spent the rest of the day preparing to continue their journey and designing weapons of different kinds. Of particular interest was a ram-pulled, bellow-powered flame-thrower from Tobias.
