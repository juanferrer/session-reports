**Start Date**: 24th September YL 1337, early afternoon

After finding a house with a good view of the well, Owl and Tobias went out to investigate the other houses and inspect the corpses. The corpses could be arranged in two groups:

- "Dry as a corn husk"
- "Torn open during the massacre"

Investigating the other houses, they arrived at the tavern, which had been spared from the slaughter. Behind the bar they found an assortment of liquors, a set of keys and a few bits. In the kitchen they found some dried fruit and meat among crates of spoiled food. Upstairs they found the owners' bedroom with the door open and the bed undone, as if someone has left in a hurry. Upon closer inspection, Tobias found a loose floorboard, under which he found a small box with what they assumed were the owners' savings. The group decided to apportion the coin to "increase the church coffers". There were also three other rooms ready for guests, but these three were locked.

On returning to the others they found Pacts still trying to figure out the meaning of the runes and they decided that, if they were going to spend the night, it was better to sleep in a comfortable bed. And so, they moved to the inn.

Whoever spent time focusing on the stone ring felt a slight pull in three different directions.

Night arrived, but nothing came out of the well. Nightmares about illnesses, war and demons assailed their rest. Tobias drew paralels between their dreams and the seventh chapter of The Witness. They decided not to wait around and decided to follow the pull in one of the directions, as they thought it might take them to other fragments of the mysterious relic. They followed the unusual compass west-north-west, towards Neverfall, a military fort at the edges of Desolation.

Their dreams continued, varying slightly, but always related to the same few chapter of the Witness. Some days they saw themselves playing Lorena's part, somedays they just witnessed the suffering of their loved ones.

Two days after setting off from Asylum and travelling through the plains, they were preparing for lunch and they felt a sudden and aggressive taste of metal , immediately followed by a painful ringing in their ears. They saw the air shimmer and tear, causing a rift to appear. As the world behan to heal its unnatural wound, two fleshy red worms slithered through, falling on the floor in front of them. The horses were clearly agitated and they struggled to keep hold of them. The whole team jumped into action, with Vrok facing the demonic entities while the other three tried to find ways to deal with them from afar. The creatures were terrifying and hard to hit, but their resourcefulness proved useful. Tobias managed to kill one of them by setting alight a bottle of brandy he found back in Asylum, while Owl stabbed the other one after regaining control of herself.

After the event they found no trace of the fissure, but they decided to recover far away from that place.

They continued their journey and as they passed the Black Lake, Owl shared a folk tale about the origin of the lake's dark tones. She spoke of a giant freshwater squid that was hunted by a local tribe. When killed, it sank, releasing ink all the way to the bottom of the lake, forever changing the colour of the water.

The plains gradually gave way to the desert, where they changed to sleeping during the day and travelling at night. They arrived on the ninth night. The guards at the gate let them through when they said they were on church business and accompanied by a member of the clergy. Instead of going to the inn as instructed they decided to crash in the barn just behind the property. They found a cozy spot in the hay and slept until worken up by the singing of an oblivious Vittoria. She runs the inn along with Harold, her husband. Over breakfast they discussed the purpose of their visit and asked for details regarding the area and a possible passage through the mountains.

Commander Visanich was caught off guard by a surprise audit from Tobias and Pacts. The middle-aged man had a large mustache, a heavy build and lots of time on his hands. Time that was not used keeping the logbooks up to date, as Pacts found out. The commander's assistant, Marten, hurriedly removed the logbooks from Visanich's office and took them away for the long process of copying and archiving. The 5 books that were left behind were five months old and seemed to be in order. Visanich reported an unusual encounter with some wild creature by the Martyr's Point officers. He had not received more details yet. When asked crossing the mountains, he informed them of a passage that was used for communication between the two forts.

As they were leaving, the commander made a poor attempt at bribing Tobias which was immediately shot down. They said they would come back to check those logs.

**End Date**: 29th September YL 1337, morning
