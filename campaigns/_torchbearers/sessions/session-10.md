**Start Date**: 3rd December YL 1337, late evening

You received reports of the ruination of Gargola. Some people managed to escape the city, but many others died. Witnesses claim the creature left in a northward direction.

Pacts shared part of his sorrow with Rosamund and explained they would need a new librarian. He also mentioned the Diligent Sacrifice and she said she would find out more about them.

The group decided to postpone the heist as they had more pressing issues at hand. And so, they followed the lake north-east, towards the Iron Peaks. It surprised them to see yet more refugees, this time travelling south from Volksbeck. They learned the city had been attacked by an similar demon (possibly the same?) that they had seen in Gargola.

Sure enough, as they approached the boundaries of the city, they could smell the burning and see the destruction. They spoke with one of the watchmen, a young man that was in charge of warning everyone but was too slow. The creature had been seen coming from the south-west, moved fast, flattened the city and continued north-west. They enquired about rests or blood from the creature and were guided to the side of one of the buildings which had been covered in a thick black substance. Now dry, they scraped some of it to experiment on. The demon blood was burned, mixed with water (holy and otherwise), sprinkled on bread and fed to mice, among other things. Much was learned of its properties.

Seeing them do all of this inspired the watch-boy, who was instructed by Owl to go to Crossings, find Rosamund and report the incident.

Further north, as they approached the mountains, they began encountering smaller villages where they were able to purchase warmer clothing and exchange their horses for mules. The merchant exchanged the clothing and services for a few of the boxes of cigars they had bought as gifts for the dwarves. Tobias threw in the marble as well. They made their way up the mountain to their village but were not well received. No one was interested in them as soon as they saw they carried no tradeable goods.

Eventually, the group made their way into the local drinking place, an extremely spartan tavern. The people ate, drank and left. They struck a conversation with Stavros, the unapproachable barkeep, who poured them each a pint of, allegedly, the mildest ale they served. Owl pretended to drink, but Tobias, Pacts and Vrok all took a sip. It burned like hell, but they managed to contain themselves to the pleasant surprise of Stavros. From there, they found Rufus, a guide brave or reckless enough to take them east, where the relic was pointing.

A preparation for the beginning of winter, it snowed consistently, if lightly, for the entire journey, although they could see a stronger storm further ahead. While preparing camp, they faced an invisible demon, silently slain by Vrok. The snow storm seemed locked in place and it raged on as the artifact guided them in. The following days were miserable. The cold was becoming unbearable and the frost was biting at their hands and feet. Their teeth chattered and their hearts beat fast. 

One night, during Owl's watch, she heard a large creature approach. From the darkness appeared a large, yet unusual, creature. A troll, dressed in rags, but highly well spoken when compared with its kin. "Who goes there?"
