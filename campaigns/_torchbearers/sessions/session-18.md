In complete shock, the group observed the skeleton methodically wake each of its companions. When all four were up, they left the dormitory towards another chamber, this one smaller with a torch fresco in one of the walls. They each lit a candle and held it by the door, waiting for the party to catch up. Very hesitantly, they entered the room and tried to light candles of their own, but after some back and forth, they realised they needed to go into the room towards the painted wall.

And when Tobias approached the relic, the wall lowered into the ground, revealing a large room lit by torches of different colours. When they went in, the wall closed behind them. The trial consisted of placing the torches in the right location, which revealed a message that they later found in the Oracle. When they solved it, the wall at the back end lowered down.

Behind it they found a room much like they one they were in, but this one was lit by directional lanterns, where the light was shining in the four cardinal directions. This test was about lighting up the room with all the torches. It proved no match for their mental power and quickly the wall in the far end lowered into the ground.

In the third room, they found a series of numbers painted up to the ceiling, where a circumpunct was painted. There were frescos of celestial bodies in the other three walls. At the bottom of the number series there were two stone reels with numbers inscribed, which they had to turn to complete the series. After some time, they figured out the puzzle and entered the correct number.

This time, however, not only the wall ahead lowered down, but also the walls behind in each room, allowing the skeletong priests in. Beyond this final door was the largest library they had ever seen. Tomes from all eras, in many different languages and about every imaginable topic. Pacts was horrified, so he waited outside. Seeing his suffering, one of the priests put Pacts in a trance where he somewhat relived the experience that had traumatised him. He was unconscious for the next three days.

During that time, the group explored the library and learned about the origins of the library and the priests, who began to slowly grow back their flesh. The "Torchbearers", as they said, were called by Aeonis when the balance of powers was at risk. Innumerable times before, a group of four chosen had embarked in the quest to prevent the destruction of the world. The last time was about 1000 years ago, and Lorena was one of the chosen, along with Vera, Barzin and Florenz. They were also given three artifacts from eons past to aid them in their quest.

Lastly, they witnessed the fulfilling of a prophecy: the stars were flickering out.
