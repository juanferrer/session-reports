**Start Date**: 12th December YL 1337, afternoon

Armed to the teeth, the group left the dwarven keep bound south, towards the centre of the storm, in the hopes the demon is what's causing it. And they were right! Only a few hours after setting off, they reached a clearing in the woods where they spotted the ice demon. This time it was on all fours moving very quickly from place to place with short pauses in between. It seemed to be looking for something. They approached quietly to get in range to fire the flame-thrower. Rufus led the goats so that the cart was pointing towards the creature, Tobias began operating the flame-thrower and hit it right in the face with the first discharge. Vrok rushed in and the demon swiped at the air, causing a gash in the air, allowing whatever was beyond to crawl through. Hundreds of tiny meat-spiders rushed towards them as Vrok rushed towards the demon. A battle that would prove deadly had just begun.

Owl hit the demon with a few of her demon-blood-tipped arrows, causing the hit point to melt violently from the fiend's body. Pacts switched to his Witch Fire, but the demon was not caught by surprise this time and managed to dodge most of it. Vrok managed a few blows, but the entity was incredibly fast.

A fire missile hit some spiders and when looking for the source, they saw the Big Wizard heading their way, shaking his staff and telling everyone to leave. He was mostly ignored, so he rushed into the fight and continued using his little living magical implementents to cast different spells.

At some point, Vrok was hit by the demon and became incapacitated, but he managed to push himself just a bit further and continued fighting while on the brink of death. Tobias, or rather the cart, became the focus of the creature, and Tobias fell as collateral damage. Rufus bravely grabbed Tobias from his seat at the now broken cart and pulled him to safety, where Owl eventually reached him and poured a potion of healing down his throat.

The troll and Owl were busy dealing with the spiders. Pacts used the final throes of his Witch Fire to light the cart, which exploded, setting the demon on fire. It demon blinked away from Vrok's side and towards the priest. It killed both Tobias and Rufus in one blow and was killed shortly after by the fire. The troll died to the spiders, which were finished off by the rest of the group.

Pacts immediately went to the Big Wizard's corpse, as Tobias had mentioned during the fight that it had the relic. The relic was being worn as a ring on a bloated finger, but Pacts used Fetch to retrieve it. Owl and Vrok rushed to the unnaturally cold corpse of Tobias. Owl prayed for him. And to everyone's surprise, so did Pacts! He joined the relic with the new piece and uttered a few words pleading for the priest's life. Perhaps thanks to their faith, Tobias came to and spoke of a vision he'd had where Aeonis himself touched him.

The group buried the body of their guide after his own custom and marked the grave with a cairn. After extensive deliberation, the group freed the four gnomes that had been enslaved by the Big Wizad, who went on their way back to their village. The blizzard had cleared by now and they returned to the city, back to Yakham's house. He thanked them long and hard for their deeds and promised a bed among the dwarves whenever they came back to the Iron Peaks. At their request, he would honour Rufus' memory and his selfless sacrifice. He also provided a guide that would take them back to the mining settlement, where Owl shared the bad tidings with Rufus' widow.
