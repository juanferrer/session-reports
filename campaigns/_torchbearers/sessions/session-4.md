**Start Date**: 2nd October YL 1337, afternoon

Vrok pushed aside the stone slab blocking the entrance to the tunnel. It was sloped down and there was a set of stairs about two metres in. They ventured into the depths and after about 25 meters, they reached a levelled area. There was a corridor and a door on their left. Doubting the safety of the main corridor, they went through the door instead, which led to a set of stairs going down. At the bottom there was a large room with pools of water and polished metal mirrors on either side. When looking into the mirror, they saw infinite copies of themselves. At the end they found a door with no keyhole. This one was locked.

After experimenting a bit, Tobias tried to look at the door through the mirrors. He noticed that there was no keyhole when looking through the mirror, but looking into water, he could see the reflection of the door in the mirror. And that one did have a keyhole! They tried a similar trick checking the rest of the room and they found a key floating in the air near the entrance. Owl mimicked grabbing the key while looking at herself through the reflections, pushing the key into the door and turning it, which successfully unlocked the door.

As before, Vrok went first. They arrived at room of a similar size to the one they had just left, but in this one they found the genealogy of whoever was buried here, a certain King Reseph.

>Hezron was the father of Jotham.<br>
>Jotham was the father of Anhurmes.<br>
>Anhurmes was the father of Hem Bai.<br>
>Hem Bai was the father of Sephoris, whose mother was Selma.<br>
>Sephoris was the father of Sebek-nekht,<br>
>Sebek-nekht was the father of Meffantis, who was king during the incursion,<br>
>Meffantis was the father of Akila<br>
>Akila was the mother of Ab Nefer<br>
>Ab Nefer was the father of King Reseph, who ruled justly all his days.

Pacts recognised the name Meffantis from the Memoirs of Grigor Spasic and made a mental note to check when they went back home.

Apart from the writing, they found jewels in the shapes of scarabs adorned with gold bases embedded into the wall all around the room. They briefly considered grabbing some of the jewels, but decided to wait for now. They continued onward, to another set of stairs leading down.

On the next level they found a locked door and beyond that a room with an altar, a pedestal and two braziers, along with what appears to be diamonds embedded into the floor. On one side of the room there was a lectern with instructions on how to perform some dark ritual. It required a relatively fresh body and with none at hand, they decided to explore a bit more.

They backtracked up to the first level and continued following the corridor they had skipped before. They skipped a few traps next to two statues of strong-looking men and reached a locked door, this one with a stylised eye embossed on the centre of the door. Next to the door there was an inscription that Pacts was able to read.

>Gaze upon the dark eye, mortal, and unravel veils of ignorance.<br>
>Behold reality in twisted shapes, where shadows whisper secrets.
>
>From distant lands and forbidden realms, knowledge shall surge forth,<br>
>a torrent of cosmic truths, both wondrous and perilous.

With no other ideas, Tobias went ahead and took a gander into the eye. But it was not the same eye anymore.

He saw himself reflected on the contracted pupil. Old, dying and reborn. Then beyond, misaligned reality, unspeakable truths. He saw the relic they were seeking, whole, complete. Nine parts coming together to drive away evil.

And so the key to the door was Tobias' sanity. The room inside was an inverted pyramid with the bottom covered in sand and stairs going around the walls to the sand. Down there they found five stone coffins similar to the ones extracted by Visanich's men. Hoping to find a body for the ritual downstairs, they opened the one in the center. And there was a body! But it had no eyes, which they required.

While discussing what to do, they heard a faint scream in the distance. They ran outside, jumped over the traps and heard several explosions coming from the level below. They discovered Marten and three soldiers had followed them into the pyramid and one of the soldiers had met their end against against some unknown trap.

The group offered to take care of the soldier and attempt to revive him. Conflicted, Marten agreed. They took the body downstairs and prepared it for the ritual. Removed both eyes and tongue, placed each in a separate container, lit the braziers, placed the eye containers one in each brazier and Pacts recited the words to complete the ritual.

A bright light flashed blinding almost everyone in the room. Owl managed to observe the skin of the soldier being consumed, the body shaking and then sitting up on the altar. The creature was looking at Pacts. Everyone was disturbed by the situation, but Pacts instructed the animated corpse to open the door.

Inside they encountered an inverted pyramid much like the one in the top level. From the elevated platform they could see 7 coffins. Standing on the sand, they noticed a pedestal with a stone ring very similar to the relic. This one looked like it would fit under the one they had. Pacts told corpse to grab the ring and bring it to Tobias. The creature walked towards it, grabbed the ring and started walking back. As soon as it did, something began to stir inside the coffins. Lids began to fall and skeletons to emerge. A mummy came out of the one in the center and attacked the animated corpse just as it passed, knocking the relic off of its hand.

Vrok immediately started swinging his axe. The mummy hit its target one more time, cracking open the head of the corpse, which fell inanimate to the ground. Pacts cast division on one of the skeletons causing it to explode into many pieces. Pacts became a big threat and was swarmed by two skeletons, who took him down. Owl rushed up the stairs and so did Tobias. Vrok ran through the battlefield, grabbed the relic and climbed the wall to the stairs. Giving one last look at Pacts, they run all the way up and closed the door behind them.

Licking their wounds, they went back to the soldiers. Seeing their state, the soldiers were not keen on going down there to retrieve Pacts, but agreed to help anyways. They gave a spare rifle to Tobias and showed him how to use it.

Reinvigorated, they returned to the king's chamber. They could hear Pacts still breathing, but didn't know how long he had left. As soon as the door was opened, Vrok rushed in and nearly killed one of the boneguards. Owl threw a torch to the mummy and instructed Marten to do the same. They both hit, but it wasn't enough to set it on fire.

All the skeletons rushed up the stairs and Vrok began pushing them off. In the meantime, Owl, Marten and a soldier prepared a rope for Owl to jump down, tie it around Pacts and be pulled up. The first time they didn't manage to pull them all the way up. Just as the mummy reached Vrok, Owl and Pacts were safe on the platform. Everyone left the room hastily and closed the door, this time for good.

**End Date**: 2nd October YL 1337, early night
