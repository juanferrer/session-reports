Shortly after leaving the dwarven settlement, Owl wrote a letter to her family and paid the son of a pedlar to deliver it to her family in Crossings.

Surprisingly, the relic didn't need time to settle, and immediately started pulling in a few different directions. They decided to travel east, towards Foundry. On their journey, they heard of a witch that had been burning small villages along the mountain range. And they did indeed see groups of houses by the foot of the mountain that had been consumed by fire. However, a little child named Lilly swore it was not a witch, but small men dressed in colourful clothing. They suspected the gnomes had something to do with this, so they decided to camp nearby and hopefully spot the culprit before any more people died.

And they succeeded! Seeing lights in the distance they thought it might be their campfire, so the group went out into the night to surprise them. When they confirmed it was the gnomes, they set up a trap for them and hid. The little men spotted the trap, but were nonetheless surprised when Owl leaped out of a bush to confront them. They played dumb until she drove a knife through Jerry's throat. The rest of the group came out of hiding and made quick work of them.

Tobias drove Constantin blind, Owl show an arrow to Perry, now in flight, and hit him in the back. Terry got another one and was impaled through the eye onto a tree. While being interrogated, Constantin told them it had all been Jerry's doing and that he had nothing to do. Owl cut his throat. Not wasting any time, she gathered the bodies, carved out their hearts and burned them. The bodies were all tied together in a bloody bundle and hung on a tree. She wrote on parchment "This land is under the protection of Aeonis" and stuck it on the tree. A few days later, she would begin sharing the story of "The Paladin of Aeonis" around Foundry.

Seeing the gnomes had nothing on them, they decided to check out their camp and found a bag with a serious amount of loot, which they swiftly took. They went back to Lilly's family's house and informed her father that her information was instrumental in solving the witch problem. Upon learning the man was a widower, he left a gold bracelet on his doorstep.

As the group was approaching Foundry, they were surprised by the Ironway, a metal carriage pulling large compartments for passengers. It was bound south, to Fortune. In Foundry they encountered dark smoke from the factory chimneys and many workers, all dirty in one way or another. While the group was busy admiring a demonstation of an automaton, Tobias became acquainted with a certain Xander, who introduced him to a fence for a small finder's fee. Tobias was able to offload some of the acquired loot and were later guided to a local inn where they spent the night.

The next morning, they set off to Tiversbog, where they hoped to find a guide or at least a boat to venture in the swamp, which was apparently the location of the next fragment of the relic. The river was full of twists and turns and animals of different kinds. A few days in they passed two men hand-fishing in the river, which they completely ignored. Further in they saw a whirlpool, which they inspected and saw unnatural fish swimming. The experience was accompanied by the familiar taste of metal, and they avoided this too.

Finally, they arrived at a hut on the swamp. A few lamps were on outside and they decided they would sneak in.
