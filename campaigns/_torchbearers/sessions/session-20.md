The entire force was mobilised, and after taking everyone's statement and gather as much evidence as they could, the priest was arrested. Chief Constable Preston apologised profusely for underestimating them and possibly being misleading. The group retired for bed and slept well into the afternoon. They quickly realised a lot had happened. The constabulary was very busy, with lots of planning and police activity.

A certain Urim had turned himself in, saying he had killed some people and that he was the monster. He had been securely chained and hopefully they would confirm whether he was actually the monster or just a lost soul. The party wasn't so sure about the holding capabilities of the chains, but the discussion went no further. Owl spoke briefly with Urim, which did seem a bit unhinged, but she managed to get enough information to somewhat confirm he had some involvement in the matter.

The rest of the plan was laid out for them. They found traces of activity in the sewers and after speaking with other branches of the city council, they selected three locations in the sewers where two or three creatures like the one discribed could nest. Squads were prepared and they would head one of them, taking their numbers up to 15. Chief Preston provided a map of the sewers and the group made their plan.

They navigated filthy sewer tunnels until they reached the place. The full squad now revised the plan and checked out all the exits carefully before slowly entering the control rooms. Slowly but surely, they met in the central room having encountered no resistance. Instead of going room by room, they decided to attract them out of their lair. When Owl's modest attempt didn't yield much result, Pacts used his clamor to great effect. Everyone positioned himself, with many around the door to surprise the creature, which worked wonders.

Between the emasculation brought upon it by Tobias and the relentless swings of Vrok's axe, the creature was quickly defeated. But not before two other monsters burst out from behind them and began killing some of the soldiers. One of them had its eyes explode and was eventually eliminated. The other one tried to flee, but was brought back into battle by Pacts' Swap.

Then Tobias blinded everyone as he transformed into a being of light, his shape no longer recognisable. The creature fell to the ground as the character pulled another similar entity from its head, this one female.
