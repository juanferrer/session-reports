**Start Date**: 17th February YL 1138, evening

The group gathered their belongings and a few provisions and left the Temple of the Candlekeepers led by the relic. They attempted to leave the desert as soon as possible and managed to avoid another encounter with the shadows. Shortly after leaving, they saw a pale blue glow coming from behind them, from the temple; the torch had been lit.

The journey was south and through Falcon Forest, finally entering the rolling belly of the Northern Reach. From there, they headed towards Sixton.

At one point during the journey, Tobias had a strange dream where a suave demon ran through the party's activities and invited him to consider the possible outcomes of their quest. Lastly, the demon proposed an alternative path, which was vehemently rejected by Tobias. Until waking, Tobias didn't know that his companions had been in his dream and witnessed the whole exchange.

The situation in Sixton wasn't calm. Not only were the drafting efforts ongoing, but there was concern among the population due to a recent murder. They later learned the incident was not isolated and that there was an ongoing police investigation. The rumours of a monster or demon were promptly dismissed by both Chief Constable Preston and Father Collins. The latter was also very welcoming and would end up providing accommodation for them.


After a sermon full of hope in the Sixton Cathedral, the group left to try and find the relic. The relic was pointing down into the ground. After checking for basements, they decided to try the sewers. They rented a workman's tent, found a manhole in a relatively quiet area and got in but found themselves limited in where they could go, as they were blocked by an iron grate on one side and moving away from their target on the other. Deciding to try another manhole, they made their way back to the exit but were called by a police officer on patrol. He found them very suspicious and asked them to accompany him to the constabulary. He took their names and advised them to behave.

Tired and disappointed, they went to the cathedral, hoping to get a place to sleep. Seeing father Collins wasn't answering the door, they broke into his home and found it empty. As they went back outside to wait for him, they noticed movement in the cathedral. And sure enough, father Collins was surprised in his nightwear, but invited them into his home and prepared beds for them.


That night, after he was already asleep, they decided to sneak out and break into the cathedral to see if they could find anything. Owl quickly unlocked the door for them and they searched the place but found nothing suspicious. Tobias decided to try the relic and it was indicating to go straight down.

Behind a heavy wardrobe they found a wooden door leading to the church's basement. In there, they found an incriminating record of father Collins' moonlighting and thorough descriptions of rituals he performed and the monsters he created. Further inside the basement, they saw one of these monsters chained to a wall. They could hear father Collins banging on the locked door upstairs, telling them to get out. They spotted the relic and as they went in for it, the creature awoke and began pulling at its chains.

The group decided to go upstairs and speak with the priest. While he was explaining everything, the creature pulled itself free and charged to them. Owl found a soft spot and quickly made the creature retreat. When they got back down, the creature had broken through the wall and ran into the sewers.

**End Date**: 2nd March YL 1138, late night
