The fish situation proved... underwhelming. Tobias quickly swam to safety and was pulled into the boat. However, the strange fish began biting the boat. Vrok outran the corrupted crocodiles very easily, but was startled by three of the swamp natives running out of the bush towards him. One of them was killed by the crocs and the other two were chased away. The group noticed the similarities between the red marks on the crocodile's hide and the men's skin. After dealing with the local fauna, Tobias grabbed one of fish to cook later. And although only Vrok and Tobias partook of the bounty of the river, the whole group endured the stinky aftermath of their digestive reckoning.

Everyone made their safe way back to Tiversbog and set up a small spectacle, with the unintended consequence of cheering up the town's population. Feeling no pull from the relic, they decided to head back to Foundry and from there travel to the capital. Tobias, with Vrok's help, set up a small unlicensed tent in the street market attempting to sell the stolen goods, but had little success until Owl came to help.

While in the thick of it, they noticed tremors, which were shortly after followed by a powerful earthquake. A large crack opened in the ground and one of the buildings and that gave place to a reality gash. But this one was much larger. Hundreds of demons of different shapes and sizes began pouring out of the gash, immediately starting to kill people in the market. As the hell rift was about to close, to massive clawed hands came out of the rift holding it open.

Tobias, made invisible by Pacts, prepared to run in with the relic to close the portal. Yet upon noticing one of the demons looking straight at him, they decided to flee, hoping to survive and fight another day. Loosing the relic was too great a risk.

And so, now out of Foundry, they rushed their horses as far from the city as they could. They spotted countless refugees in the following days. The attack seemed to have an serious effect in the province. At every major settlement after, they saw notices calling for every mage and advisor to travel to Crossings and participate in a council to prepare a plan of action. Local militias were forming and many were called to serve as if at war.

Back in Crossings they were not able to meet with Rosamund due to the council, but received some information about their previous requests. Hoping to do some good, they hatched a plan to cause Felix, Vrok's moonlight employer, to take the blame for a Lucian's fake death. What could go wrong?
