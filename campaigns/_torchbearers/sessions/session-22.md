**Start Date**: 21st March YL 1338, evening

The group made a brief stop in the town's tavern, a damp joint occupied by a few early drinkers. They learned a bit about the local happenings and went to rest hoping to set off after relic in the morning. Owl sensed a presence near their camp during the night but was unable to see anything. Vrok, in turn, had his hard-earned, blood-stained gold snatched by a local macaque.

They ventured into the dense jungle and were being followed by a group of monkeys. Vrok was enraged remembering the events of the previous night and captured one that ventured too close and shook him in an attempt to recover his money. But to no avail, the primate carried no gold and bore no guilt. Vrok is still not quite certain about the latter.

The relic took them all the way to shore, but still pointed towards the sea. They turned back and convinced Sebastian, the old fisherman, to take them back to sea. They navigated between the rocks until they found the body of a young woman lying dead on the rocks. She was covered in salt and had been bled dry. Pacts noted the resemblance with the common food-conservation method and shuddered at the thought. After encountering more bodies, they decided they would inform the locals to retrieve the bodies.

Eventually they made it to the location just above the relic. Owl was disguised as a fish by Pacts and went down to investigate. She cautiously followed the pillars to the bottom where there was no relic. She explored the area for a bit and eventually spotted what appeared to be a fisherd, a man herding fish. She quickly surfaced and was informed by the group about a second splash that came shortly after hers.

Pacts came up with a rudimentary system to bring some air down with them and they all ventured down to search the relic. They didn't see the man at first and began tracing a spiraling path outwards and eventually ran into him. He wasn't quite so happy to see them however. After freezing for a second and eyeing an opening in the rock that stood between them, he decided to flee, leaving his shoal to scatter.

The opening led to an underwater cave where they encountered a dwindling civilization of merrow. Initially dubious of their intentions, they were given water-breathing capabilities while they held conversation, at least some of them. Thalorian, who seemed to be in charge, shared dinner with them and they discussed the situation. At first he was open to exchanging the relic for a solution to their reproductive issue.

When the group attempted to leave, they intended to keep Owl as an "offering". Pacts turned Owl invisible and blood hit the water. Vrok went off, quickly killing Thalorian and his guard, but not before they reverted their Gift of Water Breathing and leaving the group breathless.
