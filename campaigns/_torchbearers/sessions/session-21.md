Once Tobias was back to himself, they had a brief exchange with the officers, who asked if they were the heroes that saved the villages up north. Without confirming or denying, the group set off to the constabulary, with the soldiers and corpses in tow.

They were deeply thanked for going above and beyond in helping the city and headed off to the cathedral hoping to get some rest. Through the night, the word spread like wildfire: "The Paladins of Aeonis walk among us". Come morning, a multitude had gathered at the entrance of the cathedral with gifts and donations, all waiting for the morning mass. The group informed everyone that the priest needed rest and that the service would be at night instead. Then Owl visited the station to ask for them to retrieve the donations and hopefully make them available for the different charitable organisations of the city. She also managed to get a hooded cloak for Tobias in hopes of making him a bit less conspicuous.

The preparations for the ~~show~~ sermon were impeccable. The special effects were in place, the relic fragment was awaiting, even the crowd control was arranged. As the flock began gathering in the nave, it became clear that their security measures were not going to be sufficient. Tobias speech was encouraging and full of hope. The relic was joined, temporarily blinding everyone, and Tobias assumed Aeonis' appearance. The crowd went wild. He healed Urim, and people brought their sick and lame for him to heal. Fearing someone would be trampled, Owl and the officers present intervened, but to no avail. When Tobias spoke, the crowd listened. He sent them to their homes.

They left the city the next morning. Back in Crossings, they spoke with Rosamund, who didn't seem thrilled about what had happened in Sixton. She informed them of the outcome at the council and inquired about their progress. Rosamund had a word with Tobias, reproaching his behaviour. When she heard him say Lorena had not been that special, she almost lost it. Tobias continued explaining they had been chosen and that Aeonis was with them. She called him out and he proved it to her, assuming his appearance once more. She went quiet after that.

Owl shared some weapon designs the group had come up with with Alistair, in particular two for the "rifles", as they were being called. One involved a small spyglass attached to the top of the weapon, hopefully increasing its accuracy. Alternatively, the barrel could be made shorter and loaded with metal shards instead of a solid bullet, which would cause the ammunition to spread over a larger area and inflict more damage. The latter didn't take a long time, so the craftsman broke down the bullets into smaller fragments and shortened the barrel, leaving Tobias with an interesting option for combat.

Now all set, the party left south-east, initially going to Fortune, where a huge storm was forming. The strong winds pushed them away, but they continued past the city which was being evacuated. Eventually they made it to the shore and found a retired fisherman that would take them further towards the island of Burbough.
