**Start Date**: 24th November YL 1137, morning

Owl didn't waste any time and ran to warn her mother not to stay in the city. She was shocked to see her, but informed her that Owl's dad was still in the city. The group quickly found Thomas and they all left right as an earthquake prepared the way for a massive demon to break through into the world. Gargola was probably destroyed.

Owl talked at length with her parents during the journey to Crossings. She met her baby brother Leonard and was caught up on their situation. They also learned of what had happened in her life for the past few years. When they arrived, Owl accompanied them through the process of having a lot assigned and later spoke with Rosamund to check on them once in a while. And maybe bring along some extra food and medicine.

The rest of the group reported to Rosamund and she asked if they needed any more resources. Their mission is very important and she felt the Church was not supporting them as much as they should. Tobias took up the offer and immediately requested a top hat and a pet hawk, which he called Tony.

Owl purchased a copy of the Sunday Witness: Year's End edition and found that her story had finished second place in the competition! When claiming the prize money, she was told they would love to publish some more of her stories and possibly put her in front of a publisher.

Pacts visited his assistant Yartham in the library at Rosamund's request. They spoke briefly and Pacts left as soon as Yartham pulled out a book. He may have noticed something was going on with Pacts, as he wrote a letter to Pacts offering to introduce him to a friend that wanted to meet him and may be able to help.

Yartham arranged a meeting between Pacts and a certain Klaus Lager, who introduced himself as part of an organisation called the Diligent Sacrifice. According to his word, the goal of the Diligent Sacrifice was to prevent the imminent arrival of a demonic entity. He handed an address to Pacts and asked him to come to them if he was interested.

Vrok was approached by a member of Felix gang and informed that the boss wanted a word. Tobias went along with Vrok to his usual drinking place and soon enough Felix arrived. He warned Vrok of getting in his way and that there would be consequences for any further defiance.

Tobias received plenty of information from Lucian's investigation. He learned of the involvement of Maggie and the Old Fishery in Felix's drug trafficking along with the likely location of the gang's administrative office.

A visit to the brothel was in order, so they all went and indulged in the available pleasures to a different extent. Tobias shared some time with Maggie and confirmed Lucian's intel. He purchased *marbles*, an allucinogenic suppository.

The next day they went to the market in hopes of finding the collectors. Fortunately they did and Owl followed them back to the office, again confirming Lucian's findings. Scouting the place they found a back window they could try to sneak through.

Later that night, as Tobias was preparing to leave for the hit, the relic reacted again, this time pointint in 5 different directions.

**End Date**: 3rd December YL 1337, late evening
