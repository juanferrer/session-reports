**Start Date**: 18th October YL 1337, early morning

For the past two weeks, the group prepared for the journey ahead. Owl studied Elvish off a dusty tome in an even dustier room in the library while Tobies picked up some pidgin-Dwarfish from a new family in the congregation. Pacts brushed up on a series of different dead languages hoping to gain some more understanding of the runes.

Strangely, Tobias has been buying pig heads, always with the eyes intact, from a local slaughterhouse. Pacts started meeting with an old lady he knew in his youth. They've been spending time alone in her shack. Vrok enjoyed his new weapons and discovered a suppressed rage inside him and he's learning to channel it for his own purposes.

Following the promptings of the sphere, they travelled south-west on well-trodden trade routes to Vadiz. There they turned west following the Eagle Creek. They left their horses along with payment for a month on the last village before the forest.

The meandering path upriver led them to the other side of the forest and reached smaller villager of much more superstitious people. They were grateful for the blessings from father Tobias, but wary of everyone else. Strangely, families were smaller, usually a single child, and everyone wore iron medallions with the symbol of the scales.

Across the river they reached Alyf Exeter, the last village before the Mistwood. Tobias gave a passionate sermon regarding Lorena and how everyone had their difficulties and was travelling through their own dark forest. Everyone loved it.

Afterwards he asked if anyone had seen anything like the relic, to which a certain Alan responded. He took them to his home and spoke with them about an experience he had when he was a child. He saw tiny old men carrying a similar object.

The group camped outside of the village, but only after Tobias got each of them a horseshoe for their tent. After an uneventful night, they ventured into the forest. Owl carved arrows pointing back on the trees they passed. The relic targed appeared to be moving erratically, so they had to change paths a few times.

In one of those turns, some of them heard a voice sharing stories. It turned out that the voice belonged to a certain Cat Bayun, a black cat sitting on a fallen tree sharing stories.

Owl was thrilled to hear all of his stories, and so were Vrok and Pacts. Tobias, however, soon fell asleep as Bayun described the delicious juices of the mouse he had caught.

After two hours of stories, the group began to worry about Tobias, so they left. Vrok carried Tobias for another hour until they wandered close to a river and saw a woman crying, washing her bloodied clothes.

Pacts, feeling sorry for the woman, approached to try to help. He was not ready for what he saw. When she turned, her horrifyng and disfigured face became visible. Upon seeing this, something broke inside Pacts. Frightened, he ran away into a tree hitting his head and fell unconcious.

Grabbing yet another unconcious friend, Vrok and Owl sped off. Moments later, they were surrounded by tiny bearded men speaking a strange tongue. The leader introduced himself as Arno and offered to take them to their camp for safety.

They laid Tobias and Pacts outside of the home of Zandre the shaman. He attempted to heal them and managed to bring Pacts back. However, Tobias remained asleep. Pacts stayed on the ground for a while longer. When he rose, he was deathly afraid of books. The librarian of Crossings wanted to burn the books.

As this was going on, Vrok met Arish, from Alyf Exeter. He got lost in the Mistwood and ran into the little men as well.

After a few more hours, Tobias awoke. Owl and Vrok explained what had happened but he was struggling to understand.

Arno invited them to the fead of the end of the harvest. There would be foor, music and plenty to drink. He stayed back with Owl and offered her some drugs as well. "For increased joy".

As Arno said, the feast was fantastic. There was also music and dancing, in which some of the group also indulged. As night fell, the festivities began to wind down. The small men started retiring to their homes and the group found a tent with makeshift bedding had been prepared for them next to the shaman's house.

A watch was set up, but Owl fell asleep during hers. When Tobias woke up for his watch, he found her asleep. He also noticed Arish's bed was empty and he could hear some music in the background. Certain that the music has stopped when they went to bed, he decided to wake up the rest of the group and have a look around.

The music was coming from the way the relic was pointing to. A bit further down from where the feast had taken place, they found a clearing in the woods. The moon was bright, but the fog was thick; they saw their little silhouettes dancing. But next to them they could see Arish, cut open and hanging from his feet.
