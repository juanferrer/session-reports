**Start Date**: 1st February YL 1338, morning

After discussing the plan with Lucian, the group decided to speak with Maggie as well, initially to gauge her commitment to Felix. Tobias decided to invite her over for dinner that night. Lucian referenced Owl to an old blacksmith friend that would be able to design and craft a prop knife for her to use in the show.

Owl and Pacts made a delicious meal for everyone with beef and vegetables and fresh bread. Lucian arrived shortly before Maggie and began helping immediately. Maggie, however, showed up prepared for a different, smaller event. Without missing a beat, she exchanged pleasantries and became acquainted with the group, and soon began reminiscing about the old times with Lucian and Tobias. Later that night, they presented the plan and she wasn't immediately against it, which was a good sign. However, she didn't think Lucian still had it in him to run town anymore. "Things have changed". In the end, she said she would do what was best for her girls and her business. Owl followed her all the way to the Old Fishery to make sure she wasn't going to immediately rat them out. 

Once Owl made it back and the final details were arranged, Tobias stood watch outside his home while the rest of the group went to the Kindling House to fetch one of the corpses awaiting cremation. They found one that looked a lot like Lucian but Vrok spotted a figure lurking nearby. Pacts called him out, waking up the neighbours and causing the figure to flee. Vrok carried the invisible body back to Tobias' while Owl and Pacts gave chase, the latter on his flying broom. The snoop was fast, but Pacts was faster. He eventually caught up with the runner and caused him to fall from a roof, breaking his arm in the process. The neighbours had alerted the Cloaks, who found the "presumed thief" and took him away. The neighbours were very pleased with the local heroes. A few hours later Tobias spotted a patrol wandering around his street.

The next morning Vrok got a cart from the market, along with a few barrels of oil. Pacts and Owl went out to scout Felix's office to hopefuly transform Owl, who then would be able to extend the disguise for as long as necessary. They also found a suspicious nightly slot on the goblin's agenda: Inventory. Vrok later told them that was an euphemism for a beat-up. Someone was not behaving and needed to be taught a lesson. Tobias tied up the agreed grey ribbon on the bridge in East Herum to let Lucian know tomorrow was the day. He also made some light conversation with one of the Cloaks on guard while a corpse rested under his bed. In this way he learned that the suspect they had arrested was a certain Gabriel, who was working for Felix. He offered to apply his enhanced interrogation techniques on the presumpt thief and the officer accepted.

The rest of the day was spent setting the stage. They located a suitably flammable warehouse, transported the body and oil and made stab marks on the former: one in the gut and one in the heart. They spilled some oil on the body and the surrounding area in hopes that it would quickly ignite. Vrok sat inside the warehouse and would wait for Lucian and Owlix to run in and proceed to set the building on fire. They planted the dossier with Lucian's info near the backdoor. Then the preaching started.

Tobias denounced the evils of Crypt, how it came to be and the role gnomes played, and also how it was affecting families in Crossings. Owlix made a point of being seen, but stood away from the crowd. As Tobias was reaching the end, Lucian arrived, placed himself near the front of the multitude, Owlix approached, enraged and stabbed Lucian in front of everyone. Lucian ran into the warehouse, followed by Felix, which triggered Vrok's part while they left through the back. Lucian jumped on a rowboat and left into the night waters.

Some members of the crowd prepared to rush in to stop the killing, but Pacts caused illusory flames to roar in front of the entrance, quickly replaced by real flames. The voice spread quicker than the fire and soon everyone was talking about that "Felix goblin who stabbed poor Lucian". When the fire brigade arrived, the building was ablaze and they mostly focused on preventing nearby buildings from catching fire.

By the next morning, every inn and tavern was aflame with rumour. Vrok learned that Felix had been taken in by the Cloaks for questioning.
