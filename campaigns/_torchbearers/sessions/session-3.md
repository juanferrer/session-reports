**Start Date**: 29th September YL 1337, morning

Owl talked to some soldiers at breakfast hoping to find out if they'd been having dreams too, but they were interested in other things, so she left.

The group met back at the inn and they planned to sneak into the office building and try to find the logbooks. As they were preparing this, commander Visanich's assistant, Marten, appeared in the inn, triggering everyone into action.

Pacts, Vrok and Tobias would go back to the office building, each following a different path. Owl stayed back to distract Marten in case he tried to leave. Or at least warn them before he arrived.

Pacts and Tobias went into the building while Vrok stood watch outside. They quickly found a room with a sign reading "Library". Pacts used a spell to take on the assistant's appearance and walked in. The title seemed overly generous when they saw the inside. Even "closet" would be an overstatement. The room contained a single shelf, with a desk next to it, where the logbooks rested.

They immediately began leafing through the books and they noticed full weeks missing every few weeks. In the older books there were fresh entries where the gaps should be. They also noticed the first few entries after a gap would always contain a spike in expenditure, usually of new equipment for the armoury, high value perishables and luxury goods.

While this was happening, Marten had breakfast and prepared to leave, only to be approached by Owl asking for a tour, or at least a story. He promised to share a story with her when he came back, as they were preparing to leave.

The assistant arrived at the office building and was stopped by Vrok, who shook his hand for an uncomfortably long time. When asked to let go, Vrok started asking questions, which only frightened Marten even more. He began to fear for his life and was ready to start screaming just as Vrok let go and broke down, confessing he was new to social interaction. Owl came to his help and explained he was just nervous, but Marten, finally free, quickly escaped into the building.

Hearing someone coming, Tobias and Pacts exited the room and confronted the assistant. He tried to explain they were catching up with the logbooks, but his attention was focused on Pacts, who looked like him. He knocked on the commander's door, who came out and became terrified at the sight of two Martens.

While his help attempted to calm him down, Tobias accused him of doctoring the logbooks and threatened to report him to the high council. Taking his chances the commander suggested he tried and told them they had an important expedition and could not be delayed any further. They took his bags and left.

Outside, Vrok and Owl saw the soldiers gathering supplies and their horses, preparing for the expedition. Visanich and Marten exited the building, mounted their horses and the entire detachment rode north-west.

The group decided to follow them and exchanged fine goods lifted from the commander's office for supplies and some upgrades to their own weapons. Owl got a small shield and Vrok got a larger-in-comparison-but-still-small shield and a large battleaxe.

They rode north-west, following both the commander and the pull from the relic and caught up to them by the end of the day, but still kept their distance and camped not too close to the other company. They had seen some members of the local tribes observing them from the distance and were cautions when night fell. Shortly before supper, Marten came to their camp on horseback and invited them, on behalf of the commander, to join them in their camp. He said everyone would be safer that way.

And so they did. That night, Marten shared the story he owed to Owl. He spoke of a boy who was changed by the faeries and never quite fit in with his peers. There was no happy ending, so Owl shared a story of her own, which was much more lively, to the enjoyment of the soldiers.

Tobias spoke with the commander about their actions, who came clean and explained they were extracting abandoned goods from a location north of the mountain range. They both apologised and shared some drinks.

The next day they rode north most of the day and were told they would arrive in the morning the next day. Tobias noted the direction of their own destination was now fully west, past the mountains. Vrok played cards with the soldiers and they all showed their weapons. The soldiers had strange tubular staves made of wood and metal. Vrok considered the effectivenes of such a flimsy blunt weapon and much preferred his own axe.

As promised, they arrived early in the morning. The location was a pyramidal structure with a hole near the base that did not seem part of the original design. It was an impressive sight, isolated as it was. Part of the soldiers stayed outside to keep watch, while Visanich with the rest of the soldiers went inside to finish their job. The group followed through a tunnel carved out of the stone and reached a large room with a tall ceiling. The walls were covered in symbols and markings that they did not recognise. The commander went straight to a stone box in one corner and unceremoniously put the treasure into bags. Then they proceeded to remove the stone box, leaving the room bare.

The group informed the commander that they would continue in their journey and he advised them to be careful in the desert, as they could be attacked by the savages. Farewells were exchanged and they went their separate ways.

With the mountains on their left, they followed their unusual compass, only to be stopped by four members of a tribe. They were armed, but didn't seem aggressive at first.

Communication was near impossible, with the interpreter barely able to string a few words together. They were asked to look in their bags and then check their persons, likely looking for stolen treasure. When they found the relic, their demeanor changed. They seemed conflicted about the situation and began to argue amongst themselves. The leader calmed everyone and he introduced himself as Bensalem Boula. The group understood that the pyramid was made by the tribe's ancestors, but the relic was made or belonged to the group's ancestors. There appeared to be more pieces of this relic and they urged them to find them, and that time was short.

Fearing a demonic incursion, they rode the rest of the day and rested near the mountains. The next day, they continued their way arriving at a point where the relic guided them downwards into the earth. A few attempts were made to retrieve the relic from under the sand, but were unsuccessful. They began to search for a possible entrance and, after a while, Pacts found something solid buried under the sand, which, when uncovered, seemed to be the entrance to some sort of underground structure. Vrok dislodged a large stone blocking the entrance and was ready to move it.
